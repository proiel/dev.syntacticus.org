Information structure and discourse factors are certainly important in determining the order of words. The general nature of this influence has been worked out in several studies (see in particular Dik 1995; Matic ́ 2003), but de- tails are still unclear, in particular because information structural categories such as topic and focus are much more subjective than syntactic ones such as subject and object. Here too, a corpus approach would lead to better replicability. In the PROIEL corpus, we have been experimenting with such higher levels of annota- tion, and the entirety of the Greek gospels have been annotation for givenness.
