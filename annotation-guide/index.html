However, there are several important differences that will be adressed in
a separate document which also discusses questions of conversion.</p> <p>Since we use a dependency grammar, word order \topicword{Word order}
is not modelled at all in our syntactic trees. The information about
word order is rather stored in a separate layer where each word is
given a linearisation index corresponding to its position in the
sentence. This means that there is no left-to-right ordering in our
trees. In this document, the ordering often but not always
approximates the linear order of the sentence. In the annotation
interface, the left-to-right ordering of trees is decided by the
dependency tree grapher and is purely conventional. If an annotation
is changed in some minor way, this may result in the dependency
grapher deciding to change the graphical representation of the
analysis tree.</p> <p>This also means that annotators can work in the sequence they
prefer. Dependents of the same node can be added in any order: it is
not necessary to add the subject, the object and other arguments in
any particular order.</p> <h2 id="the-idea-of-dependency-grammar"><a href="#the-idea-of-dependency-grammar" class="header-anchor">#</a> The idea of dependency grammar</h2> <p>Dependency grammar sets out to model the syntactic structure of sentences
as a set of <em>relations</em> between words. These relations are called
<em>dependencies</em>. It is notoriously hard to define a syntactic dependency,
but as a basis for an intuitive grasp of the concept, a word X is
dependent on a word Y just in case, if you remove Y from the sentence, you
also have to remove X.</p> <p>These relations must be <em>antisymmetric</em>, which is why they are referred to
as dependencies: if X depends Y, Y cannot depend on X. Sometimes it would
be tempting to analyse words as mutually dependent. For example, it is the
case in many languages that a preposition cannot occur without its
complement; nor can the complement occur without the preposition. Most
dependency grammarians do not tolerate such mutual dependencies however.</p> <h2 id="sentence-boundaries"><a href="#sentence-boundaries" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sentence boundaries</h2> <p>The division of the text into sentences has been done
automatically. It is based on the punctuation used in the source text,
which does not always correspond to meaningful syntactic units. In the
case of the Latin Vulgate, the source text had no punctuation at all,
so we have 'imported' punctuation from another, slightly different
text (the Clementine Vulgate). This means that there is even more
potential for errors.</p> <p>The interface therefore allows for changes in the sentence boundaries
through the use of the two buttons in the sentence division
field. 'Merge with next' will merge the sentence with the next
sentence; 'edit' will open a box which allows the annotator to split the
sentence in two by inserting a <code>|</code> (pipe character) into the
xml-presentation of the sentence. Care should be taken not to split the
sentence inside an XML element; normally, a new sentence should start
right after a space (<code>&lt;s&gt; &lt;/s&gt;</code>).</p> <p>\topicword{Grouping of main clauses} Whether two main sentences with
<em>καί</em>, <em>et</em>, ꙇ or a similar conjunction between them have been conjoined
or not depends on the punctuation used by the editor. The annotators
should in general not change this, but only verify</p> <ul><li><p>that there are no 'off-by-one' errors, ie. cases where the sentence
boundary is wrong by a couple of words. This can happen if there are
important textual deviations between the Clementine Vulgate and our
text. Also, subjunctions like <em>quia</em> are often placed together with
direct speech ('mixed speech'), but should belong with the verb of
saying.</p></li> <li><p>that the sentence does not contain two main clauses which are not
conjoined by a conjunction. In general we prefer to split such sentences
instead of coordinating two main clauses using a null conjunction.</p></li> <li><p>that there are no subordinate clauses which have been assigned to the
wrong governing main clause</p></li></ul> <p>Notice\topicword{'Mixed' speech} that the most frequent off-by-one-error
occurs when a subjunction like <em>quia</em> is put in the same sentence as
direct speech. In such cases, the subjunction should be dependent on the
verb of speech (normally via the relation <code>COMP</code>), but not itself have any
dependent, because the direct speech is marked off as a separate sentence.
Notice that sentences introduced by subjunctions should be considered
indirect speech if this is possible, ie. if there is no evidence from e.g.
pronouns (first or second person pronouns if the subject of the verb of
saying is in the third person) or other deictic elements to indicate that
the quote is direct.</p> <p>\topicword{Direct and indirect speech} Indirect speech should depend
on, and be grouped with, the sentence containing the verb of
speech. Direct speech should be separated off as main clauses. If a
sentence contains both a verb of saying and some direct speech, it is
possible to analyse this as two separate sentences, see the next
section.</p> <p>There are cases where \topicword{Parenthetical sentences} one main
clause is entirely included in another main clause as a parenthetical
sentence. Since we consider direct speech as main clauses, this is the
case whenever a verb of speech is inserted parenthetically into a
sequence of direct speech, as in the following example (Acts 25.5):</p> <blockquote><p>οἱ οὖν ἐν ὑμῖν, φησίν, δυνατοὶ συνκαταβάντες εἴ τί ἐστιν ἐν τῷ ἀνδρὶ ἄτοπον κατηγορείτωσαν αὐτοῦ.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Qui ergo in vobis, ait, potentes sunt, descendentes simul, si quod est in viro crimen, accusent eum.</p></blockquote> <p>This should be split into two sentences, a <code>PRED</code> and a <code>PARPRED</code>.
Disregarding the internal structure of the main clause, the analysis will
look the following way:</p> <p>\begin{example} \label{division}
\Tree [.Root \qroof{qui ergo in vobis potentes sunt descententes\simul si quod est in viro crimen eum}.PRED\accusent    [.PARPRED\ait  ]  ]
\end{example}</p> <p>Conversely, when direct speech is wedged into another main clause, as
сьде хь is in the following example, the direct speech is analysed as
a PARPRED:</p> <img src="/assets/img/d02794059a7f3f7111c79f19e7ded7d1c832acab.svg"><blockquote><p>аште речетъ къто вамъ се сьде хь. не имѣте вѣрꙑ</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>'If someone tells you 'Christ is here', do not believe him.'</p></blockquote> <p>But there are also longer parenthetical sentences, especially in
Paul. For the purpose of the sentence boundaries, the whole should be
treated as one sentence. In analysing the syntactic dependencies, the
verb of the parenthetical sentence should be made dependent directly
on the sentence root (and not on the main clause) via the relation
PARPRED (parenthetical predication).</p> <p>Notice that only PRED, PARPRED and VOC relations are allowed
directly under the root.</p> <h2 id="tokenization"><a href="#tokenization" class="header-anchor">#</a> Tokenization</h2> <p>The words to be analyzed \topicword{Clitics, krasis} and represented in
the dependency tree do not always match those in the text. Sometimes
elements which need to be treated as separate tokens in the syntactic
model are run together in the text. This is the case with <em>krasis</em> in
Greek, and with enclitic <em>-que</em> in Latin. The conjunction cum negation
<em>neque</em> has also been split into a conjunction part <em>que</em> and a negation
part <em>ne</em>. When the meaning is 'not even' we do not split it.</p> <h2 id="the-verb"><a href="#the-verb" class="header-anchor">#</a> The verb</h2> <p>The verb is the central element of every predication. We model this by
taking the verb to be the head of all other elements in its sentence
(except subjunctions, see section \ref{subjunctions}). We also let the
verb ''stand in'' for the sentence as a whole, which means that it is
annotated with the function of the whole sentence (unless, again, a
subjunction is present). This structure is apparent in example
\ref{division}: although the internal structure of the main clause is
not shown in the figure, we see that the main verb dominates all the
other elements of its sentence.</p> <p>Main clauses \topicword{Main clauses} do not have a function within
some larger sentence, therefore their verbs are attached to the root via
the relation PREDication:</p> <img src="/assets/img/4be32c8820318c05e9da9ffa68e6af0675691824.svg"><blockquote><p>Dico enim vobis</p></blockquote> <p>In subordinate clauses \topicword{Subordinate clauses} introduced by
a subjunction, the subjunction is assigned the relation which
corresponds to the function of the clause, and the verb is attached to the
subjunction via the relation PRED:</p> <img src="/assets/img/90622cc0d0f04c5c09d2734eb6f6230fc452aefe.svg"><blockquote><p>Dicite quia Domino necessarius est</p></blockquote> <p>For more on subordinate clauses with subjunctions, see section
\ref{subjunctions}. Sometimes the subjunction is missing even in
sentences where we would expect one, see section \ref{wosubj}.</p> <p>In other \topicword{Other\embedded\predications}contexts (relative
clauses, accusative with infinitives, absolute constructions, dominant
participles, conjunct participles and governed infinitives), verbs
will be annotated with the function of the whole construction, see
section \ref{embeddedpredication}. This means that a verb should
always be present: if it is not in the text, it will have to be
inserted, see section \ref{ellipsis}.</p> <p>Auxiliary verbs \topicword{Auxiliary verbs}are attached to the main verb
via the relation AUX:</p> <img src="/assets/img/f2b35c032c39179e4076b44267d67854bea3119f.svg"><blockquote><p>Dictum est vobis</p></blockquote> <p>Since we only allow PRED, PARPRED and VOC under
\topicword{Non-verbal predication} the root, it is necessary to supply an
empty verb whenever none is present. For example, when Jesus asks the
disciples how many baskets of bread they distributed, the disciples answer
'seven':</p> <img src="/assets/img/a8360c4069097b9b058c6acd7f1e3421cbcf2d9a.svg"><p>On the other hand, there are cases where a participle is coordinated
with a finite verb. Since we annotate syntactic function, and not form,
these are treated as PREDs, corresponding to their function:</p> <img src="/assets/img/3380312df9083ec469034cdf09e8a87f5f55b140.svg"><blockquote><p>προσεφώνησεν τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκλεξάμενος ἀπ’ αὐτῶν δώδεκα</p></blockquote> <h2 id="exclamations"><a href="#exclamations" class="header-anchor">#</a> Exclamations</h2> <p>We use the relation VOC for all kinds of exclamations.
\topicword{Vocatives,\interjections}These are placed directly under the
root, as they are external to the sentence. In the syntactic annotation we
annotate function and not form, so this relation is not only used for
vocative nouns, but also for nominative and accusative exclamations as
well as for different interjections etc.</p> <img src="/assets/img/2e642b2be5caeaffaf8ae88b332d0034e8957dde.svg"><blockquote><p>Habemus senatus consultum in te, Catilina, vehemens et grave</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/5a96a23d9117f1a2cdf15f3db713f3cd53ccb65a.svg"><blockquote><p>Amen, dico vobis</p></blockquote> <p>Some sentences consist of only an exclamation. In such cases there is no
need to introduce an empty PRED-node:</p> <img src="/assets/img/5479895e14851f5ac5f2966e44f7a8b22b9d4eaf.svg"><blockquote><p>Osanna in excelsis</p></blockquote> <p>Notice in particular that <em>ecce</em>, <em>ἰδοὺ</em>, and <em>се</em> belong here. In many
cases, these are used in presentation constructions, which should then be
analysed as involving an empty PRED \corref{10474}:</p> <img src="/assets/img/fe405b8ff8c116bdeff7ff398a29649353ad3897.svg"><blockquote><p>ecce mater mea et fratres mei</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>'Behold my mother and my brethren'</p></blockquote> <h2 id="non-verbal-sentence-level-grammatical-relations"><a href="#non-verbal-sentence-level-grammatical-relations" class="header-anchor">#</a> Non-verbal sentence-level grammatical relations</h2> <p>In this section we describe sentence-level grammatical relations, ie.
relations that have a verbal node as a head. These are SUBject,
OBJect, OBLique, AGent, XOBJ (predicative complement) and
ADVerbial, as well as some supertags described in section
\ref{supertags}</p> <h3 id="subject"><a href="#subject" class="header-anchor">#</a> Subject</h3> <p>\label{subject}</p> <p>In the typical case, SUB relates a nominative noun to its verb:</p> <img src="/assets/img/8da63a059eb1ecca413188d872fdbd76d8002e4c.svg"><blockquote><p>statim Spiritus expellit eum in desertum</p></blockquote> <p>But on some \topicword{Partitive\subjects}occasions, we also find
partitive expressions (genitive nouns and prepositional phrases) which are
subjects and must be given the relation SUB:</p> <img src="/assets/img/d1de19758a6f3f137a1a8a24ad7e62c32a9fdb8a.svg"><blockquote><p>ex discipulis eius dixerunt ad invicem</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/c309ce94c89a6b6baae19aa11db3a6af968c0cd7.svg"><blockquote><p>не бѣ има мѣста въ обитѣли (Luke 2:7)</p></blockquote> <p>Note that more generally, preposition phrases can serve as subjects in
Greek when they are nominalised by the article:</p> <img src="/assets/img/06285d4eaac27768bb7c782294fdf1224935ae8c.svg"><blockquote><p>οἱ παρ’ αὐτοῦ ἐξῆλθον</p></blockquote> <p>Note that (non-articular) infinitives are never subjects, but rather
COMPs or XOBJs, see section \ref{infinitives}.</p> <p>Subjects \topicword{Subjects in\absolute\constructions} can also be
nouns in oblique cases in an absolute construction, see section
\ref{absolutes}.</p> <h3 id="object"><a href="#object" class="header-anchor">#</a> Object</h3> <p>\label{object}</p> <p>In the typical case, OBJ relates an accusative noun to the verb:</p> <img src="/assets/img/f4440c8afceb206627171fc392925e9c12f7498f.svg"><blockquote><p>iterum intravit Capharnaum post dies</p></blockquote> <p>OCS genitive-formed accusative objects should of course also be analysed
as OBJ, not OBL. In some cases there may be doubt whether the verb
requires a genitive or an accusative, or may occur with either. In such
cases the supertag ARG should be used, see section \ref{supertags}.</p> <p>As with subjects, \topicword{Partitive\objects} we sometimes find
partitive expressions which are objects. They are given the relation
OBJ:</p> <img src="/assets/img/d7b1479495f255b9d4e10efed848e2aff7cb4bba.svg"><blockquote><p>morte afficient ex vobis</p></blockquote> <p>Partitive objects raise a problem which does not occur with partitive
subjects, since they must be distinguished from normal governed genitives
as we find, f.ex. with <em>meminisse</em>. The relation OBJ should only
be assigned if an accusative could be substituted. If in doubt, consult
section \ref{supertags}. In OCS, it can be hard to distinguish partitive
genitive objects (OBJs) from genitive objects required by the verb
(OBLs). If in doubt, use the supertag ARG.</p> <p>In OCS, negated objects regularly occur in the genitive. They should be
analysed as OBJs. Again, if there is doubt whether the verb requires the
accusative or the genitive, use the supertag ARG.</p> <img src="/assets/img/95ecfef1c6527263b8a29286158e0bddb94e014f.svg"><blockquote><p>вꙑ не вѣсте ничесоже (John 11:49)</p></blockquote> <p>Notice also that the OCS supine demands genitive objects. If the verb
requires an accusative object in other forms, the genitive object of the
supine should still be an OBJ. If there is doubt whether the verb
requires the accusative or the genitive, the supertag ARG should again
be used.</p> <p>Some verbs, like <em>docere</em>, take \topicword{Double\accusatives}
two accusatives. In such cases, annotators should first check if both
accusatives qualifies as arguments (see section \ref{advobl}). If they do,
it is possible to take both accusatives as OBJects, but this should only
be done if both accusatives could become subjects in a passive
construction. If only one of the accusatives can be the subject in
a passive construction, the other accusative must become an OBL (or an
ADV, if it does not qualify for argumenthood). Very often, it is not
possible to determine whether a given accusative can become the subject in
the passive or not; in such cases, annotators should assume that they can
be, and annotate them as object. Thus the 'default case' is that two
accusative arguments of a verb should both be treated as OBJects.</p> <p>Note that (non-articular) infinitives are never subjects, but rather
COMPs, see section \ref{infinitives}.</p> <h3 id="obliques"><a href="#obliques" class="header-anchor">#</a> Obliques</h3> <p>We use the relation OBLique to attach those arguments of the verb which
are not subjects or objects to the clausal node. By <em>argument</em> we
mean any syntactic element seen as required by a verb. This could be
a genitive, as with <em>meminisse</em>; a dative, as with
<em>sucurrere</em>; an ablative, as with <em>uti</em>; a prepositional
phrase, as with <em>pertinere</em> and in general with motion verbs; and
even an adverb, as with <em>tractare</em>. It is not always clear whether
a noun phrase is an oblique argument or not; or whether a genitive is
a partitive object or an oblique argument. If in doubt consult section
\ref{supertags}.  Oblique arguments include non-accusative 'objects' as
well as prepostional arguments.</p> <p>\topicword{Indirect\objects}</p> <img src="/assets/img/1717e7da9c50eb0de9294f10630790d68b07439a.svg"><blockquote><p>et dixit mihi angelus</p></blockquote> <p>We include all directional expressions here (goal and source) here
when they are used with motion
verbs.\topicword{Prepositional\arguments} This goes both for
prepositions and adverbs, so e.g. <em>huc</em> should very often be an
OBL. Other prepositions that are necessary to the meaning of the verb,
such as in e.g. <em>pertinere ad</em>, also belong here:</p> <img src="/assets/img/8f2cc40af036afeefb49b5095095f6b5082f4ea6.svg"><blockquote><p>et introibo ad eum</p></blockquote> <p>Path expressions, on the other hand, are normally not oblique
arguments, but rather adjuncts. Exceptions occur, however, for example in
cases where the path argument is 'required' by a preverb.</p> <p>A restricted \topicword{Arguments\of adjectives}group of adjectives
such as <em>similis</em>, <em>dissimilis</em> also take complement nouns. We
relate these nouns to their adjectives via the relation OBL:</p> <img src="/assets/img/92820b11c9da0066bb7c7ec17461f0f5f2c91daa.svg"><blockquote><p>iris erat similis visioni zmaragdinae</p></blockquote> <p>As the last example illustrates,\topicword{Objects of\prepositions}
the complement of the preposition is also considered an oblique
argument (of the preposition), no matter the function of the phrase as
a whole:</p> <img src="/assets/img/bc171bde9e41339e42b642efd49df6e4dd11277c.svg"><blockquote><p>cenabo cum illo</p></blockquote> <h3 id="agents-in-passive-constructions"><a href="#agents-in-passive-constructions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Agents in passive constructions</h3> <p>In passive constructions, and some rare active ones, we use the
relation AG to relate a non-nominative agent to the verb. A typical
example is: \topicword{PPs as agents}</p> <img src="/assets/img/f3973684a37cedf24605f573290e7cfedd9b8481.svg"><blockquote><p>quae tibi obicuntur ab his</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/c758e374c2a16271498faaeaed79a34eac8f2fdb.svg"><blockquote><p>кръсти сѧ отъ иоана} (Mark 1:9)</p></blockquote> <p>The same relation AGent is used whenever the agent is expressed by a
pure case form rather than a prepositional construction:
\topicword{Pure\case forms}</p> <img src="/assets/img/4167fff77d2e47dac9b2f073d8426ee15307ddcd.svg"><blockquote><p>ἰδοὺ οὐδὲν ἄξιον θανάτου ἐστὶν πεπραγμένον αὐτῷ</p></blockquote> <p>The AG tag is ordinarily used to express the agent with a passive verb. In
Greek, however, some intransitives are regularly used instead of the
expected passive form of a verb. Verbs occurring with this construction
include <em>πάσχω</em>, <em>πίπτω</em>, <em>φεύγω</em>, <em>εὖ</em>/<em>κακῶς ἀκούω</em>, <em>ἀποθνῄσκω</em>.</p> <img src="/assets/img/fe72b8d32b5be8dc8777f5c18271bf89e3f28682.svg"><img src="/assets/img/ff57de421af5f3a2f11bc814b880229c7266cf32.svg"><p>Since these verbs are functionally equivalent to passives and have
supplanted the passive verbs forms (although the passive of
e.g. <em>ἀποθνῄσκω</em> does also occur in the NT), we allow for
prepositional phrases with <em>ὑπὸ</em> to be marked as AG. Note,
however, that this is only allowed with a restricted set of verbs and
is most often found in Greek. There are some examples,
e.g. исцѣлѣти in \corref{40449}.</p> <p>Note finally that infinitives in Gothic are ambiguous with regard to
diathesis, so that what looks like (and is tagged as) an active
infinitive can take an agent expresssion and have passive meaning.</p> <h3 id="adverbials"><a href="#adverbials" class="header-anchor">#</a> Adverbials</h3> <p>We use the relation ADVerbial to attach adverbial expressions to the
sentence. Such expressions can take various forms: adverbs,
preposition phrases, nouns (in oblique cases), participles and
gerunds. In some cases, it is not clear whether they are adverbials or
oblique arguments, and in that case, sections \ref{supertags} and
\ref{advobl} should be consulted:\topicword{Adverbs}</p> <img src="/assets/img/437b02c55d43b6189eab26626d9687d8312e24ba.svg"><blockquote><p>epulabatur cotidie splendide</p></blockquote> <p>\topicword{Preposition phrases}</p> <img src="/assets/img/652bfddbcd318883c4658bdc7e1147201b212ab5.svg"><blockquote><p>iam moechatus est eam in corde suo</p></blockquote> <p>\topicword{Noun in\oblique case}</p> <img src="/assets/img/9781abad62c007583dcc0cc2a122fee7736d03ac.svg"><blockquote><p>Et primo die azymorum dicunt ei discipuli</p></blockquote> <p>We also consider predicative/conjunct participles and adjectives (see
<a href="#atr-or-xadv">ATR or XADV?</a> and \ref{xadv}), as well as gerunds, to be
adverbial, but they special because they are cases of embedded
predications with their own argument structure. Moreover, they are
special in that they cannot take a subject dependent. They are further
described in section \ref{open}. In the nominal domain, we do not try
to separate predicative nouns from appositions, see section
\ref{appos}.</p> <p>Adverbial accusatives \topicword{Adverbial\accusative} are also ADVs
and annotators should beware that <em>multum, multa</em>, <em>πολλά</em> and the like
are often ADV and not OBJ.</p> <p>The relation\topicword{ADV\modifying\non-verbal\elements} ADV is also
used for sub-sentence-level modifiers of adjectives, prepositions,
numerals (see \corref{36579}) and other adverbs:</p> <img src="/assets/img/008942897cf4b7cd9bd5c977cd175f100481ac1b.svg"><blockquote><p>erat valde dives</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/2dc9dc92cf4ad9a619e3644f66a618ed5ea24d25.svg"><blockquote><p>tenebrae factae sunt per totam terram usque in horam nonam</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/01005a433969c196cb35ebadd20ecd34d38c5e11.svg"><blockquote><p>et valde mane una sabbatorum veniunt ad monumentum</p></blockquote> <h3 id="predicative-complements"><a href="#predicative-complements" class="header-anchor">#</a> Predicative complements</h3> <p>The relation XOBJ is used for subject and object complements (as well
as other functions as explained in section \ref{morexobj}) which are
introduced by verbs like <em>esse</em>, <em>uideri</em>, <em>appellari</em>, <em>fieri</em>
(subject complements) and <em>facere</em>, <em>creare</em> (object complements),
as well as in verbless absolute ablatives (see section
\ref{absolutes}). The relation itself does not make clear whether we
are dealing with a subject predicative or an object
predicative. Instead, we use the slash notation to mark this, see
<a href="#slash-notation">Slash notation</a>. Note that in OCS, complements can be
instrumental-marked. They should still be analysed as XOBJs, not as
OBLs. The same goes for complements introduced by a preposition, such
as in Gothic <em>wair\th{}an du</em>, OCS бꙑти въ.</p> <p>Note that predicatives can be of many different syntactic categories:
adjectives, nouns and preposition phrases are typical examples:</p> <img src="/assets/img/42dec464cce1aafca1b21c9c7b1c036bd987988e.svg"><blockquote><p>Cicero consul est</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/f6cd0d1f8ec0e46074f3f4adc03d3c5a069b460b.svg"><blockquote><p>Romani Ciceronem consulem creaverunt</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/c47790a45ec91ebbf9e52ad029a2d0667089e464.svg"><blockquote><p>navis in medio mari erat</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/ce7de19a306932e2051886df3d8fa211a2fabc8e.svg"><blockquote><p>reddite quae sunt Caesaris Caesari</p></blockquote> <p>Notice that we also use XOBJ for some 'non-standard' copulas such as
Greek <em>ἔχω</em> in constructions such as <em>ἔχω ἑτοίμως</em> 'be ready'.
correct?</p> <h3 id="adverbal-appositions"><a href="#adverbal-appositions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Adverbal appositions</h3> <p>Although appositions are normally dependents of sentence constituents,
there is at least one case where we use sentence level appositions, namely
in the case of 'distributive elaborations', i.e. cases where
a predicational structure (normally without a finite verb) containing
a distributive element or a list. A classical example is <em>and all were
going to be enrolled, each to his proper city</em>:</p> <img src="/assets/img/29e2312e68620a5e5e76f98c6d1eb9ecbd12e238.svg"><blockquote><p>καὶ ἐπορεύοντο πάντες ἀπογράφεσθαι, ἕκαστος εἰς τὴν ἑαυτοῦ πόλιν</p></blockquote> <p>Since the appositive element is not a constituent, we need to embed
the separate elements under an empty verbal node, which is then given the
relation APOS to the finite verb.</p> <h3 id="supertags"><a href="#supertags" class="header-anchor">#</a> Supertags</h3> <p>\label{supertags}</p> <p>The distinctions that we attempt to make in our syntactic model are
not always crystal clear. Section \ref{general} offers some
supplementary advice on the use of some relations.  In order to
preserve the quality of the data, we also provide certain supertags
which the annotators should use when they are in doubt, instead of
simply choosing one of the alternatives. These are:</p> <ul><li><p>PER for peripheral (not subject or object) elements, ie. OBL or
ADV. This should be used whenever it is not possible to decide whether
an element is an argument or an adjunct.</p></li> <li><p>ARG for arguments, to be used whenever it is not possible to decide
whenever an element is an OBJect or an OBLique.</p></li> <li><p>NONSUB for non-subjects, ie. elements that are either OBJets,
OBLiques or ADVerbials.[^1]</p></li></ul> <p>In addition there are supertags for verbal functions, see section
\ref{verbsupertags} and a supertag for adnominal functions, see
section \ref{adnom}.</p> <h3 id="auxiliary-words"><a href="#auxiliary-words" class="header-anchor">#</a> Auxiliary words</h3> <p>Items that are not covered by these tags are simply given the tag Aux,
which serves to mark auxiliary verbs, modal particles, focus
particles, negation etc. Information about these items is always
recoverable from the categorial information in their morphology. The
intuition behind the relation Aux is that it serves to mark off
'grammatical words' as opposed to 'lexical words'. There are certain
adverbs whose meaning can sometimes be so weakened that they appear as
grammatical words (<em>ergo</em> signalling simple progression for
example), so the distinction between Aux and ADV is not always clear.</p> <p>It can be a bit confusing that the Aux tag is used for so many
different groups. What these words have in common is that they do not
really bear a syntactic function towards their heads, they just give
additional information about them. An article specifies the
definiteness of its head noun; a negation negates its head word, a
focus particle gives information about the information status of its
head, auxiliary verbs gives tense and aspect information relating to
the verb etc.</p> <p>It is important to attend to scope issues: auxiliary verbs should be
attached via Aux to their verbs; focus particles and constituent
negation should be attached to the items they take scope over. In
general, a scoping item is considered to scope over its mother node
and all nodes dominated by its mother, and it should be placed
accordingly. For more on this, see section \ref{scope}.</p> <p>[^1] This case is extremely rare, of course, but the tag can also be used to flag anomalies which the reviewers should look at.</p> <h2 id="noun-phrases-without-nouns"><a href="#noun-phrases-without-nouns" class="header-anchor">#</a> Noun phrases without nouns</h2> <p>\label{npnonoun}</p> <p>Sometimes a sentence-level function is not filled by a noun, but by an
adjective, participle or a numeral. Such elements should be given the
appropriate function in the sentence, and should <em>not</em> be related to an
empty node representing the 'elliptical' subject, object or otherwise:</p> <img src="/assets/img/133e6c08cbbf2116b289efb1f6a5b6ddadd65e38.svg"><blockquote><p>omnes ex illo biberunt</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/846f0e799f82b0541185cd595908af0647548c9e.svg"><blockquote><p>responderunt prudentes</p></blockquote> <p>Before opting for such an analysis, the annotators should make sure
that the adjective/participle is not predicative. The example above means
'The wise ones answered'. If the sentence meant 'Being wise, they
answered' or 'They answered wisely', <em>prudentes</em> would have been an
XADV, see section \ref{xadv}.</p> <p>As we have seen in the sections on the subject (\ref{subject}) and the
object (\ref{object}) even prepositional phrases can be subjects and
objects, especially when they express partitivity. Another
construction, which is fairly frequent in Greek, is the nominalisation of
prepositions and adverbs in constructions like <em>οἱ παρ’ αὐτοῦ</em> 'the ones
around him' or <em>οἱ νῦν</em> 'people nowadays'. In such cases, the preposition
should be the head and the article an Aux, as usual:</p> <img src="/assets/img/6a8e1a290dfeadaf40b002c4411d333ce0d03b11.svg"><blockquote><p>οἱ παρ’ αὐτοῦ ἐξῆλθον</p> <p>'The ones around him went out'</p></blockquote> <p>Sometimes there are several adjectives, participles and/or
numerals. In such cases annotators will have to make a choice as to
what is the head of the construction and what is the
modifier/attribute. In general, the element which is most central to
establishing the referent should be the head.</p> <p>This means that numerals should not be the head if there are other
available heads, so <em>alii duo</em> 'two others' should be</p> <img src="/assets/img/4d42759539d6b6cb4333a3904ae2d97e55531707.svg"><p>and not the other way around. Generally the hierarchy is</p> <blockquote><p>adjectives, participles &gt;&gt; nominalized prepositional phrases &gt;&gt; demonstratives &gt;&gt; indefinite pronouns &gt;&gt; numerals &gt;&gt; relative clauses</p></blockquote> <p>This means that <em>tria haec</em> should be</p> <img src="/assets/img/df89dffc15a101a6a20c68b93d9db056372b4d67.svg"><p>and <em>haec omnia</em> should be</p> <img src="/assets/img/4e192872b12b5b4a5515cb93d5c27bad0cdd2cbb.svg"><p>Notice that since relative clauses are lowest on the hierarchy, sentences
like <em>omnis quicumque confessus fuerit in me</em> will be representendes as
relative clauses modifying the quantifier:</p> <img src="/assets/img/908a18f6c29954fc10d45c8c9f59a4656c359ef0.svg"><blockquote><p>'whoever believes in me'</p></blockquote> <h2 id="adnominal-tags"><a href="#adnominal-tags" class="header-anchor">#</a> Adnominal tags</h2> <p>\label{adnom}</p> <h3 id="general"><a href="#general" class="header-anchor">#</a> General</h3> <p>Dependents of nouns can be of various types. There are negations,
emphatic particles etc. which are related via Aux, but with due
consideration of scope issues (see section \ref{scope}). In general,
'grammatical words' will bear the relation Aux, whereas 'lexical
words' which are dependents of nouns will have various relations
depending on their function. We recognise 4 main types:</p> <ul><li><p>ATR: attributes are elements which serve to restrict the reference of
a noun. For example, in <em>canis albus</em> the adjective <em>albus</em> serves to
restrict the possible reference of the noun <em>canis</em>. Attributes can be
adjectives, prepositional phrases, relative clauses, participles,
genitives, number words - but these categories can also have other
adnominal functions, so it is important to pay attention here.</p></li> <li><p>APOS: appositions are elements which serve to further elaborate on
a nominal referent, without restricting the reference. Examples are
<em>consul</em> in <em>Cicero consul</em>, <em>frater</em> in <em>Marcus frater</em>. Appositions
are mostly nouns in the same case as their head, and non-restrictive
relative clauses.</p></li> <li><p>PART: partitives are elements which tell us to which group or whole
the noun belongs. They are typically realised by genitives or by
prepositions like <em>ex</em>, <em>de</em>, <em>ἀp'o</em> etc.</p></li> <li><p>NARG: some elements can be said to be <em>arguments</em> of nouns. The most
clear example is the object genitive, as in <em>spes uincendi</em> or <em>amor
fati</em>. Arguments can also be realised as prepositional phrases, as in
e.g. <em>Dei amor erga nos</em>. Here <em>erga</em> is an argument of <em>amor</em> (and
<em>nos</em> is in turn an argument of <em>erga</em>). Note that subject genitives are
counted among the normal possessive genitives, as attributes. Arguments
of adjectives are <em>not</em> NARGs but OBLs.</p></li></ul> <p>These categories are further explained and exemplified in the following
sections. There is also supplementary information in section
\ref{general}. If in doubt annotators should use the supertag ADNOM.</p> <h3 id="attributes"><a href="#attributes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Attributes</h3> <p>Attributes are given the tag ATR. Here is an example with an adjective
and a possessive pronoun:</p> <img src="/assets/img/eb05e8eedf2647a238cd879a07f2bce1e2b17233.svg"><blockquote><p>pater vester caelestis perfectus est</p></blockquote> <p>Here is a \topicword{Descriptive\genitives}subtree involving a
descriptive genitive and a numeral which is an attribute of the
genitive noun:</p> <img src="/assets/img/83d5a081cdd8002fe3980068d284e2855e6fa6d5.svg"><blockquote><p>puer decem annorum</p></blockquote> <p>There are various other possibilities not illustrated here, such as
possessive genitive (<em>patris filius</em>) and definitive genitives (<em>arbor
fici</em>). Also, restrictive relative clauses are considered attributes, see
section \ref{relatives}.</p> <p>We use \topicword{Non-traditional\attributes} the tag ATR also for some
constructions which are not traditionally called attributes, f.ex. because
we do not allow nouns to take adverbial dependents. If a noun (f.ex. the
name of a city or a small island in Latin) is equivalent to a directional
prepositional phrase, dependent adverbs will have to be ATR and not
ADV:</p> <img src="/assets/img/1bacd7cc5bf4623524093d5ab63f97359c5731e7.svg"><blockquote><p>et miserunt Barnaban usque Antiochiam</p></blockquote> <p>Therefore it is useful to think of the ATR as not only comprising
traditional attributes but all kinds of modifiers of nouns.</p> <h3 id="appositions"><a href="#appositions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Appositions</h3> <p>\label{appos}</p> <p>This section deals with adnominal appositions. We also use the APOS tag
in a variety of sentential contexts, see <a href="#adverbal-appositions">Adverbal appositions</a>.</p> <p>Appositive nouns are attached to their head noun via the relation APOS.
Such nouns are never restrictive (if they are, they are attached via the
relation ATR instead), and we do not attempt to keep apart predicative
appositions from other appositive nouns.</p> <img src="/assets/img/71128f9f2c054da8b41eb206c2aa69be9de4ddd5.svg"><blockquote><p>Cicero consul coniurationem Catilinae detexit</p></blockquote> <p>Non-restrictive relative clauses are also considered appositions, see
section \ref{relatives}.</p> <p>Notice \topicword{Names and\modifyers\of names} in particular that
'second names', and modifiers of names, as in <em>Maria Magdalena</em> or <em>Iesus
Christus</em>, are always considered appositions. In OCS, such ‘second names’
are generally denominal adjectives.</p> <p>There can sometimes be doubt whether a participle is an apposition or
a predicative adjunct. In general, APOS should be chosen whenever
a timeless property of the head is expressed, or at least a property which
is not tied to the time of the governing verb, as in the following
example:</p> <img src="/assets/img/3c56f665f3e35afe05aa005fc359ee792341063c.svg"><blockquote><p>Εἰσῆλθεν δὲ σατανᾶς εἰς Ἰούδαν τὸν καλούμενον Ἰσκαριώτην, ὄντα ἐκ τοῦ ἀριθμοῦ τῶν δώδεκα</p> <p>'Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve'</p></blockquote> <p>Being called Iscariot and being one of the Twelve are properties of
Judas that are not temporally connected with the event of Satan entering
Judas, so we use XADV instead of APOS.</p> <p>When multiple expressions with the same function
occur,\topicword{Appositions and\word order} it is often difficult to
decide which one to take as the head and which one as the
apposition. In such cases we follow the surface word order: the
expressions which comes first in the sentence is taken as the head,
while the one that follows, is taken as an apposition.</p> <img src="/assets/img/28fda24a26453a1ca8ecb83ea4d8a05ea0490a7c.svg"><blockquote><p>не и ли сестрꙑ его сѫтъ оу насъ сьде</p> <p>'Are not his sisters with us, here?'</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/73070b07f43f491d01454ecfb910d6f33dbd873e.svg"><blockquote><p>καὶ οὐκ εἰσὶν αἱ ἀδελφαὶ αὐτοῦ ὧδε πρὸς ἡμᾶς</p> <p>'Are not his sisters here with us?'</p></blockquote> <p>In the Greek text, the adverb comes first and the PP second while in
the OCS text it is the other way around. Following linear principle,
we take the PP as an apposition on the adverb in the Greek text while
in the OCS text the adverb is taken as an apposition on the PP. It is
important to remember, however, that this approach is only possible when
the two (or more) elements have <em>the same function</em>, in this case both
functioning as place adverbials. A time adverbial should not be taken as
an apposition on a place adverbial even though they both carry the ADV
tag.</p> <h3 id="partitives"><a href="#partitives" class="header-anchor">#</a> Partitives</h3> <p>Adnominal partitive expressions are typically realised as genitives or
preposition phrases:</p> <img src="/assets/img/be07a8a7a853de67b86c456fcec99e9a89353f81.svg"><blockquote><p>Unus ex eis mortuus est</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/ff834847761e9bc30fb4d0f94368cf922f5a3fdd.svg"><blockquote><p>Unus eorum mortuus est</p></blockquote> <p>Notice that PART is reserved strictly for adnominal partitives. It
should <em>not</em> be used for partitive objects. These are OBJs, and only the
morphology signals that they are partitives. This means that <em>ut ab
agricolis acciperet de fructu vineae</em>, there is no partitive: <em>de fructu
vineae</em> is a normal object of <em>acciperet</em>.</p> <p>The PART relation is not limited to the meaning 'one of/some of'. It is
also used for other part-whole relations as in</p> <img src="/assets/img/1816a3767a90880ecce0db00a5693b8f03e0774e.svg"><blockquote><p>Maria accepit libram unguenti</p></blockquote> <p>Genitives required by numerals (as often happens in OCS, but also in other
languages) should be analysed as PART:</p> <img src="/assets/img/2c3c1f37602473e596b0d8b944e8f42c31f4d208.svg"><p>In general, PART should not be used for 'components' such as body part
nouns, or 'the root of the tree' and similar: there should be
a <em>contingent</em> part-whole relationship, not a permanent one. The head will
generally be a measure noun of some sort.</p> <h3 id="arguments-of-nouns"><a href="#arguments-of-nouns" class="header-anchor">#</a> Arguments of nouns</h3> <p>\label{narg}</p> <p>Nouns, especially deverbal nouns, can take arguments just like
verbs.[^1] A clear case are
so-called objective genitives, but also other items like prepositional
phrases can be NARGs:</p> <img src="/assets/img/3dfa477adc516d1a8ff88e75fc39323532177008.svg"><blockquote><p>baptismus est ingressio in sanctitatem Dei</p></blockquote> <p>In OCS, arguments of nouns can sometimes be denominal adjectives, as
\ocs{бзии} in the following example:</p> <img src="/assets/img/0cac0686d26856087e8deccfdfffb69a7bc69981.svg"><p>Verbal nouns, such as infinitives and gerundives, are often NARGs when
they are dependent on deverbal nouns, but they can also restrict the
nouns, see section \ref{adnominf}.</p> <img src="/assets/img/a5bc7ab5738d201e01c04c1ada96e6bfb12b4e59.svg"><blockquote><p>Tota spes vincendi est in confirmatione</p></blockquote> <p>In such cases, there is not always a clear subject in the sentence. But if
there is one, it should be marked by a slash arrow. Consult sections
\ref{gerunds} and \ref{infinitives} for further information.</p> <p>[^1] However, nouns very rarely take direct object arguments,
although some exceptions are found e.g. in early Latin.</p> <h2 id="embedded-predication"><a href="#embedded-predication" class="header-anchor">#</a> Embedded predication</h2> <p>\label{embeddedpredication}</p> <p>Embedded predications \topicword{Open and closed\predications} are
divided in two major classes according to whether they can have their own,
overt subject or not. Predications which cannot have an overt subject are
called <em>open</em>, because their subject is supplied from outside the
construction. They include some infinitives, such as the complement
infinitives of <em>posse</em> -- witness the grammaticality of <em>potesne mihi
auscultare</em> as opposed to *<em>potesne te mihi auscultare</em> -- and conjunct
participles, whose subject is always coreferent with some other element of
the sentence, but never expressed as a dependent of the participle. Open
predications are further discussed in section \ref{open}. Sections
\ref{types} to \ref{auc} describe various kinds of closed predications.</p> <p>The distinction between open and closed predications has to do with
being a sentence or not. 'Real' subordinate sentences, introduced by
subjunctions, have all it takes to be a sentence: a subject, a
predicate, aspect, voice, etc. etc. Accusative with infinitive structures
and absolute construction and even the <em>ab urbe condita</em>-constrution also
have these characteristics. So we can refer to these as subordinate
<em>sentences</em>. Conjunct participles are also like sentences in some ways,
but differ in a crucial respect, since they do not have their own subject.</p> <h3 id="the-basic-types-of-subordinate-clauses"><a href="#the-basic-types-of-subordinate-clauses" class="header-anchor">#</a> The basic types of subordinate clauses</h3> <p>\label{types}</p> <p>Traditional grammar divides subordinate clauses into three groups:
substantival sentences, adjectival sentences and adverbial
sentences. This distinction reflected in our annotation.</p> <h3 id="substantival-sentences"><a href="#substantival-sentences" class="header-anchor">#</a> Substantival sentences</h3> <p>\label{substantival}</p> <p><em>Substantival sentences</em> are also called complement sentences because
they complement the main verb. They often seem to have the same functions as
nouns, most often as objects, but sometimes as subjects. However, we do not
attempt to keep such functions apart, but use COMP for all of them. We treat
them this way, because in a sentence like <em>dicitur Homerum caecum fuisse</em>, it
is not easy to tell whether <em>Homerum caecum fuisse</em> is the subject of <em>dicitur</em>
or rather the object of an impersonal construction.</p> <p>In effect COMP 'overrules' other relations whenever an argument is
sentence-formed. Most of the time it functions as a subject or an object, but
sometimes sentences can be arguments of nouns, in which case they are marked as
COMP rather than NARG; or as predicatives (in sentences like 'My will is
that'), where they are COMP instead of XOBJ.</p> <p>Substantival \topicword{Types of\complement\sentences} sentences are
typically AcIs, indirect questions and subordinate clauses introduced by
<em>quod</em>, <em>quia</em>, ѣко and <em>ὅτι</em> (in the meaning 'that', not 'because', which
introduces an adverbial sentence). Notice that in Biblical Greek <em>ἵνα</em> is also
used to introduce complement clauses much more regularly than in Classical
Greek. In Latin, complement clauses can also be introduced by <em>ut</em>, <em>ne</em>,
<em>quominus</em> and <em>quin</em>.The criterion is that the sentence is selected by the
verb: <em>persuadere</em> selects an <em>ut</em>-sentence, f.ex., so this sentence is a COMP.
The same goes for locutions like <em>prohibeo quominus</em> and <em>haud dubito quin</em>.
Sometimes a subordinate clause is not introduced by any subjunction at all and
such subordinate clauses are always COMPs.</p> <p>The COMP relation takes precedence over other relations, even in adnominal
contexts. A complement sentence which is dependent on a noun should therefore
be COMP, not NARG, as in <em>τὸ εὐαγγέλιον ὅτι...</em>, see \corref{6516}.</p> <p>Notice that an <em>ut</em>-sentence which depends on
<em>persuadere</em> differs from the <em>ut</em>-sentence which can be
added to any verb, to express intention. A fairly comprehensive list
of verbs that take completive <em>ut</em> in Latin is: <em>accidit</em>, <em>adhortor</em>, <em>adipiscor</em>, <em>admoneo</em>, <em>caveo</em>, <em>cogo</em>, <em>concedo</em>,
<em>constituo</em>, <em>contendo</em>, <em>contingit</em>, <em>convenit</em>, <em>decerno</em>, <em>denuntio</em>,
<em>deprecor</em>, <em>dico</em>, <em>edico</em>, <em>efficio</em>, <em>enitor</em>, <em>evenit</em>, <em>facio</em>, <em>fit</em>, <em>flagito</em>,
<em>hortor</em>, <em>impello</em>, <em>impero</em>, <em>impetro</em>, <em>incito</em>, <em>interdico</em>, <em>interest</em>,
<em>iubeo</em>, <em>laboro</em>, <em>mando</em>, <em>mereo</em>, <em>moneo</em>, <em>obsecro</em>, <em>opto</em>, <em>oro</em>, <em>permitto</em>,
<em>persuadeo</em>, <em>peto</em>, <em>placet</em>, <em>posco</em>, <em>postulo</em>, <em>praecipio</em>, <em>praescribo</em>,
<em>precor</em>, <em>rogo</em>, <em>scribo</em>, <em>sequitur</em>, <em>sino</em>, <em>statuo</em>, <em>studeo</em>, <em>suadeo</em>,
<em>subigo</em>, <em>volo</em>. No such list is available for Biblical Greek or the
other languages, but the intuition to follow is that with verbs with
the above semantics, the <em>ut</em>-sentence belongs closer to the
verb than in other cases, where it introduces an adverbial sentence.</p> <p>For guidelines on how to annotate the various complement sentences,
consult sections \ref{subjunctions} (finite sentences with
subjunctions), \ref{wosubj} (finite sentences without subjunction),
\ref{AcI} (accusative with infinitive) and \ref{indqu} (indirect
questions).</p> <p>Our representation is therefore:</p> <img src="/assets/img/a641248e3e95229bc7fd84cca3cffa7b681aa30f.svg"><blockquote><p>dicitur Homerum caecum fuisse</p></blockquote> <p>Notice that the so-called nominative with infinitive is treated differently:</p> <img src="/assets/img/6e4af385af0e11261efc3e311cc98030994a7f7c.svg"><blockquote><p>dicitur Homerus caecus fuisse</p></blockquote> <p>In the nominative with infinitive, the infinitive no longer has its

attached to the subjunction via the same relation PRED that we use in
main clauses. The subjunction is related to the matrix clause via COMP
if it is a complement clause:</p> <img src="/assets/img/d0b905bef125c0358a27c9130bb21feeafa09040.svg"><blockquote><p>audistis quis dictum est antiquis non occides</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/767468c13893363dbd10f5c543b79865b379c81f.svg"><blockquote><p>datum est illis ne occiderent eos</p></blockquote> <p>Only a restricted group of subjunctions introduce COMPs, see the
discussion in in section \ref{substantival}. Many more subjunctions
introduce adverbial sentences, consult section \ref{advsen}.</p> <p>In Greek, verbs of saying such as <em>λέγειν</em> or
<em>εἰπεῖν</em> may take a complement clause introduced by
<em>ἴνα</em>, in which case the speech verb itself is intrepreted as
expressing the will of the speaker.</p> <img src="/assets/img/1b4d7b2868dea416b8b424c7bac3f85015b3dba5.svg"><p>\corref{6622}</p> <p>When a speech verb is overtly present, we assign the relation COMP to
the subjunction <em>ἴνα</em>. When no speech verb is present,
however, <em>ἴνα</em> may function as a subjunctive marker and the
clause may act as a main clause equivalent to an imperative clause.</p> <p>Notice \topicword{Modification\of a subjunction} that in most cases the
subjunction will only have a single daughter, the verb, although sometimes a
subjunction can be modified. For example, we can have <em>εἰ καί</em> or <em>et si</em> (=
<em>etsi</em>) where <em>καί</em>/<em>et</em> modifies the subjunction:</p> <img src="/assets/img/cf97b9bc6c9d297cff05c9c2fc690792c5a8e2ee.svg"><blockquote><p>et si omnes fuerint scandalizati</p></blockquote> <p>This means 'even if everyone is scandalized'. In cases where <em>et si</em> means 'and

not have a subjunction. Instead, they are introduced by an element (the
relative pronouns or adverbial) which also has a role in the sentence, such as
subject, object, oblique or adverbial. Therefore these sentences should be
headed by the verb directly, and the relative or interrogative should be
annotated with its function within the clause. In other words, it is <em>never</em>
correct to let an adverbial or relative word head a sentece.  This also goes
for relative adverbs like <em>ubi</em> and similar words.</p> <p>Annotators are often tempted to let the relative pronoun depend on its
antecedent: after all it agrees with its antecedent in gender and number. But
we annotate syntactic <em>function</em> and function is indicated by <em>case</em>. On the
other hand, the verb of the relative clause should be made dependent on the
pronoun's antecedent (if there is one) since that is what the relative clause
modifies.</p> <p>The verb of such subordinate sentences is given the relation
corresponding to the function of the sentence as a whole. There are
several possible functions.</p> <p>The verb of a relative clause with an antecedent is attached to
\topicword{Adnominal\relative\clauses} the antecendent via the
relation ATR (restrictive relative clauses) or APOS (non-restrictive
relative clauses):</p> <img src="/assets/img/0f809e9121830a1bd425b008cf1b784762c4ef1e.svg"><blockquote><p>Et viri qui tenebant illum, illudebant ei</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/3834a77f33f530b910198a6adc6084e5d9db8be8.svg"><blockquote><p>dicit Deus qui est omnipotens</p></blockquote> <p>Whenever there are two verbs which share one relative word, we make
the relative word dependent on the closest verb, but it is important
to add a shared argument slash from the second verb to show that we
deal with a relative clause. However, this is only possible when the
relative pronoun has the same function in both clauses, see below.</p> <p>If the verb of the relative clause was instead attached via the
relation ATR, this would correspond to the semantic interpretation
''the god who is omnipotent'' (in contrast to some other god). If it
is not possible to decide whether a relative clause is restrictive or
not, use the supertag REL.</p> <p>It is important that not only \topicword{Relative\adverbs}relative pronouns,
but also relative adverbs should be annotated this way, since relative adverbs
also have a function within their own clause. The same goes for interrogative
adverbs. The following sentence illustrates <em>ubi</em> in both uses:</p> <img src="/assets/img/faa6d77d396d27f5c61b3ec914fc9d14cb396dfc.svg"><blockquote><p>ubi est refectio mea ubi pascha cum discipulis meis manducem</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/8632970bee73310748329f6489ddf836cc396cd0.svg"><blockquote><p>обрѣте мѣсто идеже бѣ написано</p></blockquote> <p>If there is no antecedent \topicword{Relatives\without\antecedent}
for the relative pronoun, the verb of the relative clause will itself
bear a sentence-level function within the matrix clause:</p> <img src="/assets/img/38719e67fcd31dcd74c447d4196e66b347a9c12d.svg"><blockquote><p>qui habet aurem, audiat</p></blockquote> <p>Although this implies that we take the relative clause to be a noun
phrase, we avoid adding nominal modifiers to it, so quantifiers such
as <em>πᾶς</em> and <em>omnis</em> are taken as heads of the relative
clauses, see also \ref{npnonouns}.</p> <p>Notice that this style of annotation implies that the relation of the
subordinate verb changes if the correlate is left out. Consider the
following two sentences:</p> <img src="/assets/img/12e8389db43e650ce56c2302b03401498ae00f6e.svg"><blockquote><p>scribe ea quae vides</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/40080208d4262362329db409714108aa8fd498c5.svg"><blockquote><p>scribe quae vides</p></blockquote> <p>Leaving out the correlate changes the function of the relative clause, which is
annotated on its verb, from an attribute which restricts the reference of <em>ea</em>
to a direct object of <em>scribe</em>.</p> <p>A variant of headless relative clauses are those which have an
internal head.\topicword{Internally headed\relative clauses} In this case the noun is given its function inside the
relative clause (normally with the relative pronoun as an ATR):</p> <img src="/assets/img/f451b7882f23e52d05e188cc67d454985659cc5d.svg"><blockquote><p>et in qua mensura mensi fueritis metietur vobis</p> <p>'In what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you'</p></blockquote> <p>Sometimes the correct position of the relative pronoun can be deep
inside the clause it introduces, e.g. in an embedded accusative with
infinitve:</p> <img src="/assets/img/75f0a25cd75be9f0b6c2b6245fb9f28ee7f846b6.svg"><p>Sometimes a sentence where the relative pronoun does not have a role
is coordinated with the real relative clause. We still coordinate such
clauses, and use shared argument slashes where we can. In the
following example, the relative pronouns arguably does have a function
in both sentences, but not the same function (it could be an ADV in
the second clause), so we cannot express this in our notation:</p> <img src="/assets/img/8c4eb672f0a3ec6af75cb11998d1c9b620b17d84.svg"><blockquote><p>ꙇ вьзвѣсти имь. елико ти гъ сътвори и помилова тѧ</p></blockquote> <p>In correlative constructions the relative sentence is made a dependent
on the correlative: if the relative sentences precedes it is in most
cases an APOS (as this is a topicalizing construction,
cf. \ref{resumtopic}. Else it is normally, but not always,
restrictive.</p> <p>Finallly, notice that infinitives sometimes can have a function
similar to that of relative clauses, see section \ref{adnominf}.</p> <h3 id="indirect-questions"><a href="#indirect-questions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Indirect questions</h3> <p>\label{indqu}</p> <p>Indirect questions are like relative sentences in that there is no
element which introduces the sentence. The interrogative
pronoun/adverbial has a function inside the sentence and must be
annotated accordingly. The verb of the indirect question is given the
function of the whole subordniate sentence, which in the case of
indirect questions is almost always COMP:</p> <img src="/assets/img/213e60f9b01712bfb81bcca9c9c17d797923a278.svg"><blockquote><p>quaesivit quare exivisset</p></blockquote> <p>However, in rare cases a dependent question can have adverbial
(e.g. conditional) force:</p> <img src="/assets/img/07e2c532b8ae2169fb955fb3933d1d6d4149dc29.svg"><blockquote><p>quis autem ex vobis patrem petet panem numquid lapidem dabit illi</p></blockquote> <h3 id="infinite-predication-accusative-with-infinitive-aci"><a href="#infinite-predication-accusative-with-infinitive-aci" class="header-anchor">#</a> Infinite predication: Accusative with infinitive (AcI)</h3> <p>\label{AcI}</p> <p>Again we let the infinitive verb stand in for the whole
construction. In the normal case this construction consists of a
subject in the accusative, a predicate which is a verb in the
infinitive and possibly further arguments and adjuncts. The infinitive
is given the relation COMP:</p> <img src="/assets/img/b7edf969eade451c3e7fe72f79a6c0ba0b1388ad.svg"><blockquote><p>vidi stellam de caelo in terram cecidisse</p></blockquote> <p>However, it can happen that the predicate infinitive is
lacking.\topicword{Elided\infinitive} Most often the elided
infinitive is <em>esse</em> or a similar verb, and we introduce an
empty, verbal node:</p> <img src="/assets/img/a6f50d78e4038b77dd892279005f24ec72efe758.svg"><blockquote><p>quando te vidimus infirmum aut in carcere</p></blockquote> <p>Accusative with infinitive structures should be kept apart from pure
infinitives which cannot take a subject, as with the complement
infintives of auxiliary verbs like <em>posse</em>, <em>velle</em>. For the
annotation of the latter structures, consult section \ref{open}.</p> <p>However, \topicword{AcI without\subject} since the subject is not
always present in an accusative with infinitive structure, it is
sometimes hard to tell whether a given infinitive is part of an AcI
with an unexpressed subject or is an open complement. In addition,
some verbs allow both constructions. For example, both <em>uolo id
facere</em> and <em>uolo me id facere</em> are possible constructions in
Latin. In examples like <em>uolo id facere</em>, <em>facere</em>
should be treated as an open complement (XOBJ) and not part of an AcI
with a deleted subject. An elliptical AcI should be assumed only if
the matrix verb does not allow an open complement construction.</p> <p>There are \topicword{COMP vs\OBJ+XOBJ}structures where one could be
in doubt whether an accusative noun is the object of the main verb or
the subject of the subordinate verb. Consider f.ex. the causative
construction with <em>facere</em> + accusative noun + infinitive, as
in <em>fecit omnes accumbere</em>. <em>omnes</em> could be analysed as
the subjet of <em>accumbere</em> or as the object of
<em>fecit</em>. Both analyses would in principle be possible, but
annotators should always use the AcI analysis with the accusative noun
dependent on the infinitive:</p> <img src="/assets/img/91802ce74e3ec5b0678bcaf06f0c4d059c9344ad.svg"><blockquote><p>fecit omnes accumbere</p></blockquote> <p>This is a purely conventional choice and applies only to accusative
nouns. In structures with a dative noun and an infinitive, f.ex, the
noun is made dependent on the matrix verb, as in <em>licet mihi
exire</em>, see section \ref{impers}.</p> <p>OCS sometimes \topicword{Dative with\infinitive}has datives with
infinitives that behave very much like AcI. The construction consists
of a dative subject, a predicate which is a verb in the infinitive,
and possibly other dependents, and the entire construction is a COMP
to e.g. a speech verb. It should be analysed like AcIs:</p> <img src="/assets/img/21320b8b05a89dc57acbb1d60142d917f505eece.svg"><blockquote><p>придѭ садоукеи иже глглѭтъ не бꙑти вьскрѣшению (Mark 12:18)</p></blockquote> <h3 id="infinite-predication-absolute-constructions"><a href="#infinite-predication-absolute-constructions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Infinite predication: absolute constructions</h3> <p>\label{absolutes}</p> <p>Absolute constructions are embedded predications with an adverbial
relation to the rest of the sentence. We consider the participial verb
to be the head of the construction. It is therefore related to the
matrix clause via the relation ADV:</p> <img src="/assets/img/e9a9fdd0236248db1fd9d1d172cb61b0a5466904.svg"><blockquote><p>convocata turba dixit eis</p></blockquote> <p>The predicate in an absolute construction need not be a verb: it can
be a noun or an adjective. In such cases, we assume an empty verb:</p> <img src="/assets/img/76c2431eeecbaa681ede43ed532403db9313e704.svg"><blockquote><p>Cicerone consule senatus coniurationem Catilinae detexit</p></blockquote> <h3 id="infinite-predication-dominant-participles-and-gerundives"><a href="#infinite-predication-dominant-participles-and-gerundives" class="header-anchor">#</a> Infinite predication: dominant participles and gerundives</h3> <p>\label{auc}</p> <p>Latin has a special type of an embedded predication which looks like a
normal noun phrase: sometimes noun + agreeing participle/gerundive
corresponds to an English translation with a verbal noun translating
the participle (or gerundive) + a dependent genitive. Thus <em>ab
urbe condita</em> means 'from the founding of the city', and not 'from
the founded city'; <em>Caesar occisus</em> can mean 'the murder of
Caesar' (ie. 'that Caesar was murdered') and not 'the murdered
Caesar'. In such cases, we consider the participle/gerundive to be the
head of the construction and the noun is attached via the
SUB-relation, whereas the participle/gerundive is annotated with the
function of the whole predication.</p> <p>Probably the \topicword{<em>ad</em> + noun\+ gerundive} single most
frequent case of such a construction, is the <em>ad</em> + gerundive +
noun construction. In this locution, the noun is almost always
dependent on the gerundive:</p> <img src="/assets/img/2f3baeebec9cf86406222f47aa0873db42cbd81d.svg"><blockquote><p>venit ad libros legendos</p></blockquote> <p>But the <em>ab urbe condita</em>-construction is found in other contexts as well:</p> <img src="/assets/img/7ef4e4b3515eca68d6dd26a1a006478b449983c8.svg"><blockquote><p>superbus victa serpente est</p> <p>'(Apollo) is proud that the serpent was defeated'</p></blockquote> <h3 id="open-predications"><a href="#open-predications" class="header-anchor">#</a> Open predications</h3> <p>\label{open}</p> <p>Open predications are predications that do not supply their own
subject, but get a subject via coreference relations[^1] within the sentence. Their subject is not
necessarily a nominative. Finite verb forms never take part in open
predication, only infinite forms. The infinite verb form heads the
whole construction and is related to the matrix verb via the relation
corresponding to the function of the embedded predication + a prefix
X. We distinguish two kinds of open predications according to whether
they are arguments which <em>complement</em> a verb or adverbials
which <em>modify</em> a verb.</p> <p>In some cases, infinite verb like infinitives and gerunds can depend
on nouns. In these cases, they are never given the relations XOBJ or
ADV, but are most often NARGs. Consult section \ref{narg}, as well as
\ref{gerunds} on gerunds and \ref{infinitives} on infinitives.</p> <h4 id="xobj-tag"><a href="#xobj-tag" class="header-anchor">#</a> XOBJ tag</h4> <p>Infinitives can also be objects of verbs. This typically happens with
auxiliary verbs like <em>uelle</em>, <em>posse</em> etc.:</p> <img src="/assets/img/093699e1a3fc0490cff140468569f58eaba75757.svg"><blockquote><p>non potest se ipsum facere salvum</p></blockquote> <p>But it is also found with some other verbs, such as <em>dare</em>:</p> <img src="/assets/img/9162144fca4a03dcc73c6f4a1a67f883b4518de5.svg"><blockquote><p>dabo ei edere de ligno vitae</p></blockquote> <p>Such constructions are different from other embedded predications
(AcI's etc.) in that no subject can be added. Instead the subject is
supplied by coreference with an element which is either present in the
matrix clause, such as <em>ei</em> in the last example, or implied by
the argument structure of the matrix verb, as the implied subject of
<em>potest</em>. This coreference should be marked by means of the
slash notation, see section <a href="#slash-notation">Slash Notation</a>.</p> <p>The so-called\topicword{Nominative with\infinitive} nominative with
infinitive construction also involves an XOBJ:</p> <img src="/assets/img/7e9abf6fff058e17e2a9c21182939919087293f1.svg"><blockquote><p>Terentii fabellae a Laelio scribi putabantur</p></blockquote> <p>XOBJs are not always infinitives; some verbs, like \scriptgr{l'hgw }
govern a participle which is then related to it via XOBJ. The
coreference between the subject of the participle and the subject of
the matrix verb is again marked via the slash notation. Also,
perception words which take an accusative with participle construction
are analysed as taking the accusative as an object and the participle
as an XOBJ:</p> <img src="/assets/img/1ae5481c85e43a135adfd69e3a73985064543b80.svg"><blockquote><p>Vidi puerum currentem</p></blockquote> <h4 id="xadv-tag"><a href="#xadv-tag" class="header-anchor">#</a> XADV tag</h4> <p>\label{xadv}</p> <p>Conjunct (or predicative) participles are adverbials which modify the

the tag XADV:</p> <img src="/assets/img/03b4d879fe59649b2c6d5e79bcf093f0faf9b14d.svg"><blockquote><p>Galli laeti in castra pergunt</p></blockquote> <p>Participles and adjectives are given the tag ADV when they are
predicative, ie. do not restrict the reference of a noun phrase but
rather modify the main verb, ie. the above sentence means 'The Gauls
proceeded happily into the camp.' whereas the meaning 'The happy Gauls
proceeded into the camp.' would be represented as</p> <img src="/assets/img/5704883610ea50bf176069c1670741e61a9a3d85.svg"><blockquote><p>Galli laeti in castra pergunt</p></blockquote> <p>OCS reciprocal pronouns have two components, and prepositions come

in the numerous cases in the New Testament where a sentence is
introduced by a conjuction (_et and others), this should not be
treated as coordination, but the <em>et</em> should be attached to the
sentence predicate via the relation Aux. In many sentences there is
one introductory conjunction, which should be an aux under the first
verb, and then a coordination of two verbs:</p> <img src="/assets/img/810cff9a8b6d62d827760342202ad85675ac4ea7.svg"><blockquote><p>Et veniunt et dicunt illi</p> <p>'And he came and said to them'</p></blockquote> <p>We adopt a restrictive definition of conjunctions. Only items which
can actually coordinate two words into a phrase. These are the words
we recognize as conjunctions:</p> <ul><li><p>Gothic: <em>ai\th\th{}au</em>, <em>ak</em>, <em>akei</em>, <em>alja</em>, <em>a\th\th{}an</em>, <em>jah</em>, <em>ni</em>, <em>nih</em></p></li> <li><p>Greek: <em>ἀλλά</em>, <em>εἴτε</em>, <em>ἤ</em>, <em>ἤτοι</em>, <em>καί</em>, <em>μηδέ</em>, <em>μήτε</em>, <em>οὐδέ</em>, <em>οὔτε</em>, <em>τέ</em></p></li> <li><p>Latin: <em>an</em>, <em>atque</em>, <em>aut</em>, <em>et</em>, <em>neque</em>, <em>neu</em>, <em>que</em>, <em>ve</em>, <em>vel</em>, <em>sed</em></p></li> <li><p>OCS: али, да, и, а, или, любо, ни, нъ</p></li></ul> <p>The slash arrow notation, which is used extensively in this section,
is further explained and discussed in <a href="#slash-notation">Slash Notation</a>, often
with the same examples being used.</p> <p>In \topicword{Types of\coordination} analysing coordination, the
first step is to ascertain what kind of elements are being conjoined:
the conjuncts can be either constituents, multi-rooted elements, or
sentences.</p> <p>A constituent, \topicword{Constituent}in the sense of a dependency
grammar, is a node together with all the nodes it dominates: for
example, a noun with all its attributes and appositions is a
constituent. In <em>Cicero consul coniurationem Catilinae detexit</em>
(see the tree on page \pageref{Cicero}), there are exactly five
constituents: <em>consul</em>, <em>Cicero consul</em>,
<em>Catilinae</em>, <em>coniurationem Catilinae</em> and
<em>Cicero consul coniurationem Catilinae detexit</em>.^[2] However, the latter constituent, which
corresponds to a sentence, is treated differently from other
sentences. By definition a constituent has a single root.</p> <p>A \topicword{Multi-rooted\elements} multi-rooted element is a set if
nodes which are not connected, ie. does not have a common
mother. Consider <em>tradet frater fratrem in mortem</em> (example
\ref{mors} = \ref{mors1}): <em>frater fratrem in mortem</em> has a
common mother node, the verb, but this is not present in the string,
so this set of nodes is as such multi-rooted. And still, it can be
coordinated with another element, as in <em>tradet frater fratrem
in mortem et pater filium</em>.</p> <p>A sentence \topicword{Sentences} is a constituent dominated by a
finite verb, or by an empty node which stands in for a verb, or by the
infinitive in an Accusative with infinitive construction.</p> <h3 id="coordination-of-constituents-single-rooted-elements"><a href="#coordination-of-constituents-single-rooted-elements" class="header-anchor">#</a> Coordination of constituents/single rooted elements</h3> <p>\label{concoord}</p> <p>Coordination of constituents is the most straightforward case,
especially when the constituents are single words. Consider the
example '<em>quid nobis et tibi Iesu Nazarene?</em>'. <em>nobis</em>
and <em>tibi</em> are conjoined by <em>et</em>. They are both OBLique
arguments of a (elliptical) <em>esse</em>, but so is the whole phrase
<em>nobis et tibi</em>. We therefore want to have both <em>nobis</em>,
<em>tibi</em> and <em>nobis et tibi</em> as constituents which bear
the OBL relation and we achieve this by having the conjunction
dominating both <em>nobis</em> and <em>tibi</em> via the relation
these would have had to the main verb if there was no
coordination. The conjunction then inherits this relation and is
attached to its head via the same relation that it bears to its
daughter(s):</p> <img src="/assets/img/9304a381456eff4616f4d9460e47725a8fb799c0.svg"><blockquote><p>Quid tibi et nobis, Iesu Nazarene?</p></blockquote> <p>If there are more than than two elements, all conjuncts are attached
to the conjunction in the same way. Often there will also be more than
one conjunction. In such cases, the first conjunction (not counting
conjuntions which occur before the first conjunct!) should serve as a
head of the coordinated phrase, and any further conjunctions should
depend on the first one via the relation Aux</p> <img src="/assets/img/b9a28e4c23c360f09d8e4553b70933fd20aad8bf.svg"><blockquote><p>scio opera tua et quia non potes sustinere malos</p></blockquote> <p>If there is no conjunction present we insert an empty node which behaves as a conjunction.</p> <p>We use essentially the same analysis whenever the conjuncts are single
rooted but share a subtree. Consider the string <em>boni viri et
cives</em>. There are two possible analyses: the intended meaning can be
'good men and citizens (which are not necessarily good)' (tree (a)
below)- in that case we have constituent coordination, since
<em>viri</em> and its attribute <em>boni</em> is a constituent which
is related to the constituent <em>cives</em>. But the meaning can also
be 'good men and good citizens' (tree (b) below), in which case
<em>boni</em> modifies both <em>viri</em> and <em>cives</em>. We
represent the difference in the following way:</p> <img src="/assets/img/0b0495ad827818c54bc247057780ecab5f5ecdfc.svg"><img src="/assets/img/5b44a1ab6ed867ec68b6120ad1900aa996225e58.svg"><p>In this way, the adjective has correct scope, see section \ref{scope}.</p> <p>Notice that there is an alternative way to express shared attributes
like this, namely through slash notation. The practice of putting
shared elements on conjunctions is used when the coordinated elements
are not finite verbs; for finite verbs sharing elements, the slash
notation <em>must</em> be used.</p> <p>In analysis\topicword{Identity\of function} of single root conjuncts,
it is important to ensure that both conjoined elements have the same
function, ie. should bear the same grammatical relation. SUBs can only
be coordinated with SUBs, OBJs with OBJs etc.  Only in this way is it
possible to give the conjunction a correct function.</p> <p>There \topicword{Coordination\of ADV and XADV} are some exceptions to
this, however. The XADV-relation, which can be coordinated with an
ADV-element. In such cases the conjunction is given the relation XADV
(and not ADV). This makes it possible to slash from the conjunction to
the appropriate subject, and have the XADV inherit this
slash.[^3]</p> <p>Also,\topicword{Coordination\of COMP and OBJ} is allowed, and the
resulting coordinator node should get the OBJ function. In a very few
cases we also recognize coordination of COMP and OBL, and the
coordinator node is labelled OBL.</p> <p>If the relations of the two conjuncts are not identical, another form
of conjunction must be used. Of course, beside the conjuncts
themselves, the coordination can have 'superfluous' conjunctions
bearing the relation Aux, as well as items that are shared between the
two conjuncts.</p> <p>Sometimes the principle of identical relation leads to slightly forced
analyses:</p> <img src="/assets/img/26e4bdbaf23a36543061348fda022f1fc92c6d00.svg"><blockquote><p>καὶ διηγήσαντο αὐτοῖς οἱ ἰδόντες πῶς ἐγένετο τῷ δαιμονιζομένῳ καὶ περὶ τῶν χοίρων</p></blockquote> <p>It would perhaps seem natural to take <em>πῶς ἐγένετο τῷ
δαιμονιζομένῳ</em> and <em>περὶ τῶν χοίρων</em> as coordinated
arguments of the main verb, but since their relations differ we cannot
do this, and have to do a gapping analysis instead.</p> <p>The principles described in this section are only applicable to <em>constituent</em>
coordination. Whenever the two elements which each have more than one root are
coordinated, the construction must be treated as described in section
\ref{multiroot}. One case which is not infrequent is the coordination of two
object + object predicative structures. Even though we might like to conceive
of an object + an object predicative as a single constituent, they have no
common root except the governing verb in our model. We must therefore treat
such coordinations as sentence coordinations, see example \ref{tosmstn}.</p> <p>On the other hand, it <em>is</em> possible to coordinate two XOBJs:</p> <img src="/assets/img/f0c92f024e6e9ecf8694ca2fe36dd55c4e63b127.svg"><blockquote><p>vidit spiritum descendentem et manentem</p></blockquote> <p>In this case, there should be a slash from the conjunction <em>et</em>
to <em>spiritum</em>, see <a href="#slash-notation">Slash Notation</a>.</p> <p>It is also possible to coordinate a nominal object with an accusative
with infinitive, even if the object takes a predicative complement:</p> <img src="/assets/img/41f7f03b007aa9ba467f80b5ae0f4e0d351de87a.svg"><blockquote><p>invenit puellam iacentem supra lectum et daemonium exisse</p></blockquote> <p>In this case there should be a slash from <em>iacentem</em> to
<em>puellam</em>. The example illustrates how our analysis relates to
the semantics of the sentence in such cases: the subject of
<em>invenit</em> preceives both the girl (<em>puellam</em>) and some
proposition about here (that she is lying down,
<em>iacentem</em>). The subject also perceives a proposition about the
demon (<em>daemonium exisse</em>), but he does not directly perceive
the demon, and therefore <em>daemonium</em>, unlike <em>puellam</em>,
is not a direct object of <em>invenit</em>. Notice that the analysis
involves coordination of COMP and OBJ, see section (\ref{compobj}).</p> <p>On the other hand, whenever there is a coordination of two groups of
OBJ + XOBJ, we need to treat this as gapping because there is no
common root for the OBJ + XOBJ group, see example (\ref{tosmstn}).</p> <h3 id="sentence-coordination"><a href="#sentence-coordination" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sentence coordination</h3> <p>\label{sc}</p> <p>Although technically it would be possible to model VP
coordination in the same way as other
coordinations of single rooted conjuncts which share a subtree, we do
not pursue this option. Instead we follow the spirit of dependency
grammar and assume that every finite verb, as well as infinitives in
accusative with infinitives, forms a sentence. This also ensures
consistency in the analysis, since - given the liberal use of pro-drop
subjects in ancient IE languages - it is often not possible to
determine whether we have sentence coordination or VP coordination.</p> <p>Consider <em>homo induebatur purpura et bysso et epulabatur
cotidie</em>. There is no way of knowing whether the two conjunts are
<em>induebatur purpura et bysso</em> and <em>epulabatur cotidie</em>,
with the subject belonging to both conjuncts, or rather <em>homo
induebatur purpura et bysso</em> and <em>epulabatur cotidie</em> with a
zero subject in the second conjunct. To avoid making such decisions,
we treat all such cases as sentence coordination and mark shared
arguments via the 'slash notation', see section \ref{ellipsis}. The
representation is therefore:</p> <img src="/assets/img/f6f1e269b7f1aae40192ed194a655fae67b07ce4.svg"><blockquote><p>homo induebatur purpura et bysso et epulabatur cotidie</p></blockquote> <p>If there is more than one conjunction present, the first one which occurs between two conjuncts will dominate
the coordinated elements, whereas subsequent conjunctions will be
attached to the first one via the relation Aux. Any conjunction preceding the first conjunct will be an Aux on that first conjunct:</p> <img src="/assets/img/9b36410bf5f81edef8ee62f175d19e05e1af323d.svg"><blockquote><p>et quattuor animalia dicebant amen et seniores ceciderunt et adoraverunt</p></blockquote> <p>In subordinate clauses without a subjunction, the verbs do not bear
the relation PRED but corresponding to the funtion of the subordinate
clause. Conjunct verbs are analysed as sentence coordination here too:</p> <img src="/assets/img/e01001b88bb32655bc41d46732be1644a656e69f.svg"><blockquote><p>qui uiuit et aurem habet, audiat</p></blockquote> <h3 id="conjunction-of-non-constituents-multi-rooted-elements"><a href="#conjunction-of-non-constituents-multi-rooted-elements" class="header-anchor">#</a> Conjunction of non-constituents/multi-rooted elements</h3> <p>\label{multiroot}</p> <p>The conjuncts do not always have a single root. Consider a sentence
like 'John drank coffee and Peter beer.' The second conjunct here is
'Peter beer' which is not a constituent and does not have one root but
two unconnected roots, 'Peter' bearing a SUB relation and 'beer' an
OBJ relation. We must first create a common root for them. This will
be an empty node functioning as a conjunction. The empty node and the
sentence are then conjoined in a way similar to sentence
coordination. Both are given the relation PRED, but the second
conjunct lacks the verb and is therefore marked with a slash arrow
towards the overt verb, ie. it is a kind of predication which shares
the central element, the predicate, with the first conjunct):</p> <img src="/assets/img/4054dcd74377414a9d45fbc7ad323c24ff7a86ca.svg"><blockquote><p>εἶδεν σχιζομένους τοὺς οὐρανοὺς καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα καταβαῖνον εἰς αὐτόν</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/1ce207a5a7b3a721ec5cbadf1514656e79d3bb2a.svg"><p>In other cases, not only the predicate but also other elements can be shared between the two conjuncts.</p> <img src="/assets/img/c2b511fced3f20b5ad815b884b8fe62fafc2078d.svg"><blockquote><p>Ὁ λόγος γὰρ ὁ τοῦ σταυροῦ τοῖς μὲν ἀπολλυμένοις μωρία ἐστίν, τοῖς δὲ σῳζομένοις ἡμῖν δύναμις θεοῦ ἐστιν</p></blockquote> <h3 id="in-which-conjunct-does-an-element-belong"><a href="#in-which-conjunct-does-an-element-belong" class="header-anchor">#</a> In which conjunct does an element belong?</h3> <p>It is sometimes not clear how the conjoined domains should be
delimited and in which conjunct an element belongs. If the element is
shared between the two conjuncts, the question is which dependency
should be marked directly in the tree, and which one by a slash
arrow. This does not affect the semantic interpretation of the
sentence in any way, since the element is shared. For such questions,
consult section \ref{belong}.</p> <p>It can happen that it is clear that an element belongs to only one
conjunct, but it is unclear which one that is. In such cases, the
choice will determine the interpretation. If in doubt, the annotator
should consult standard translations. The principles in section

'and' from the <em>particle et</em> 'also'. This latter should be

mean 'not even', in which case we do not split it into its constituent
parts <em>ne</em> + <em>que</em>.</p> <p>[^1] These relations are normally analysed in terms of <em>raising</em> and <em>control</em>.
[^2] In a phrase structure grammar, on the other hand, all words would be constituents, as would the VP (verb + object) <em>coniurationem Catilinae detexit</em>.
[^3] Note that the relation between OBJ and XOBJ is different, since verbs subcategorize differently for these functions whereas ADV and XADV are not subcategorized functions.

are often elided. In such cases we insert an empty copula:</p> <img src="/assets/img/3a390ec024cf8a5bf0cad4cc523e6295621b2e95.svg"><blockquote><p>beati pauperes spiritu quoniam ipsorum est regnum caelorum</p> <p>'Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven'</p></blockquote> <p>Note that we have to assume an empty copula even in some cases where

<em>interfecit</em> 'he killed him'. The only kind of ellipsis that we
<em>do</em> mark is so-called gapping, ie. cases where shared material
in a coordinated structure is left out in one or more of the
conjuncts. Such conjuncts are treated as sentences, ie. we insert an
empty verb which is given the relation PRED, and the shared elements
are stored in a list, as explained in section \ref{multiroot}. One
further example will suffice:</p> <img src="/assets/img/dead6cb965a0a19b04cd6fa0d56a17393270a18d.svg"><blockquote><p>unam incolunt Belgae, aliam Aquitani</p></blockquote> <p>Notice that for the purposes of this rule, we treat XADVs as coordinated

like NPs in other languages:</p> <img src="/assets/img/588fb55f5b95de70e2e71decfb0854db223e7aa1.svg"><blockquote><p>καὶ κατεδίωξεν αὐτὸν Σίμων</p></blockquote> <p>However, \topicword{Possible\configurations} many Greek noun phrases
contain one or more definite articles which can appear in various
configurations, DAN, DNDA, NDA, ADN and DNA:^[1] <em>ὁ ἀγαθὸς
ἀνήρ, ὁ ἀνήρ ὁ ἀγαθός, ἀνήρ ὁ ἀγαθός, ἀγαθός ὁ ἀνήρ</em> and <em>ὁ
ἀνήρ ἀγαθός</em>. In the last two onfigurations the adjective is
normally considered predicative and not attributive, so there is a
functional difference as well as a difference in word order. For our
purposes, this means that adjectives in configurations like
<em>ἀγαθός ὁ ἀνήρ</em> and <em>ὁ ἀνήρ ἀγαθός</em> should not be
related to the noun via ATR, but rather to the verb via XADV. The
article, on the other hand, is related to the noun via Aux. Note that
since our syntax is dependency-based and not configurational, there is
no difference between <em>ταχύς ὁ ἀνήρ τρέχει</em> and <em>ὁ
ἀνήρ ταχύς τρέχει</em>:</p> <img src="/assets/img/1efce0e2e923300fc7b1085c1359316b9abccd35.svg"><blockquote><p>= ταχύς ὁ ἀνήρ τρέχει or ὁ ἀνήρ ταχύς τρέχει</p></blockquote> <p>In other cases, where the adjective is attributive, we always attach
the article to an item on the right: the noun, if this occurs to the
right of the article (but not necessarily directly to the right);
otherwise to the adjective. This means that the dependency structure
distinguishes between <em>ὁ ταχὺς ἀνήρ</em> and <em>ἀνήρ ὁ
ταχύς</em>:</p> <img src="/assets/img/3bf0e7c5cc4348e3ea5ffdee31a762f31d0cc738.svg"><blockquote><p>ἀνήρ ὁ ταχύς τρέχει</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/0ab97ffeb684c31e5542c9084cbd7cd410ad82f0.svg"><blockquote><p>ὁ ταχὺς ἀνήρ τρέχει</p></blockquote> <p>In the final case, there is an article preceding both the noun and the
adjective and we attach each one to the element to their right.
<em>ὁ ἀνήρ ὁ ταχὺς τρέχει</em> ends up as:</p> <img src="/assets/img/edf32ff137cab313daade6571a3f71cbfaa123c5.svg"><p>However, the modifier in an NP need not be an adjective; it can be a
genitive NP, an adverb etc. We attach the article to that element of
the modifier which is related to the noun via ATR:</p> <img src="/assets/img/e8a30602adf096ad2639b77792ace3488a361a12.svg"><blockquote><p>Ὁ λόγος γὰρ ὁ τοῦ σταυροῦ τοῖς μὲν ἀπολλυμένοις μωρία ἐστί</p> <p>For the preaching of the cross is foolishness to them that perish.</p></blockquote> <p>Notice that in the structure of <em>ὁ τοῦ σταυροῦ</em>, both

non-nominal categories like adverbs or preposition phrases. The
adverb/preposition will be the head of the construction and given the
appropriate relation, and the article will be a dependent of the

within one dependency tree (which can of course contain several
coordinated main clauses). Informally, the general principle is that a
whenever an item 'needs' to have a dependent, but this dependent is
already 'used' (ie. is a dependent of something else).</p> <p>In other \topicword{Interpretation} words, the meaning of a slash is
<em>not</em> that the slasher node[^1] is referentially identical
to the slashee node.[^2] Rather, the slash arrows should be
conceived of as supplementary dependency relations: the slashee node
is a dependent of the slasher. There is one exception to this
principle, namely when the slasher is an empty node which bears the
PRED-relation, see section \ref{multislash}.</p> <p>To understand this general principle, consider the sentence
<em>Caesar non potuit mingere</em>. The dependency tree is</p> <img src="/assets/img/40b73cee0917454946806cd6080ff6fa32c3bcc6.svg"><p>Caesar is correctly designated as the subject of
<em>posse</em>. However, Caesar is also the subject of
<em>mingere</em> and to represent this fact, we put a slash arrow from
<em>mingere</em> to <em>Caesar</em>:</p> <img src="/assets/img/80b1e8bc218045cb249652e922c395a1de45c927.svg"><blockquote><p>Caesar non potuit mingere</p></blockquote> <p>The interpretation of this notation is that the subject of
<em>mingere</em> is coreferent with the subject of <em>posse</em>,
which is <em>Caesar</em>.</p> <p>We can distinguish two groups of uses of the slash notation, one
associated with the 'open' functions XADV and XOBJ, and
one associated with gapping and elliptical coordination.</p> <h3 id="open-functions-xadv-and-xobj"><a href="#open-functions-xadv-and-xobj" class="header-anchor">#</a> Open functions: XADV and XOBJ</h3> <p>The open functions XADV and XOBJ were introduced in section
\ref{open}. By definition, they do not supply their own subject, but
get a subject via coreference relations within the sentence. From the
perspective of traditional grammar, it is perhaps not clear that
nominal predicatives behave in the same manner, but consider the
example <em>Caesar calvus est</em>. <em>Caesar</em> is the subject of
<em>est</em>, and <em>calvus</em> is the predicative complement of
<em>est</em>:</p> <img src="/assets/img/094c4f40820082e0c775accfe09eb436d079c5a7.svg"><blockquote><p>Caesar calvus est</p></blockquote> <p>However, we want to capture the fact that not only is <em>calvus</em>
an argument of <em>est</em>, in the sense that <em>est</em> requires
the presence of a predicative complement, <em>calvus</em> is also a
predication about <em>Caesar</em>. In other words, <em>Caesar</em> is
the subject of <em>calvus</em> and this is represented by a slash
arrow from <em>calvus</em> to <em>Caesar</em>:</p> <img src="/assets/img/b4021b29490c000ad2e683da5bd2ad012cb90eb1.svg"><blockquote><p>Caesar calvus est</p></blockquote> <p>The same holds for a traditional 'object predicative', as in
<em>Romani Ciceronem consulem creaverunt</em>: <em>creare</em>
requires three arguments, a subject, an object and a predicative. So,
<em>consulem</em> is a XOBJ-dependent of <em>creaverunt</em>, and
<em>Ciceronem</em> is a OBJ-dependent of <em>creaverunt</em>, but at
the same time, <em>Ciceronem</em> is the subject of <em>consulem</em>
and we capture this fact by a slash arrow from <em>consulem</em> to
<em>Ciceronem</em>:</p> <img src="/assets/img/16998c8069730c9fa17aa787b4d2d835b4fa7f9b.svg"><blockquote><p>Romani Ciceronem consulem creaverunt</p></blockquote> <p>With the relation XADV, the facts are the same. Consider <em>ille respondens dixit
eis</em>: <em>dixit</em> is the main verb, <em>ille</em> its subject and <em>eis</em> its oblique
argument. <em>respondens</em> is an adverbial which modifies the main verb,
contributing the extra information that the 'saying' was 'responding'. So
<em>respondens</em> is an XADV-daughter of <em>dixit</em>, but we also want to express that
<em>ille</em> is the subject of <em>respondens</em>:</p> <img src="/assets/img/2ea95c30dc7fc14a725742953ff1a695f94a6032.svg"><blockquote><p>Ille dixit eis respondens</p></blockquote> <p>Now what if there was no overt subject in the sentence, ie. if the
subject of <em>dixit</em> was pro-dropped and the sentence read
<em>respondens dixit eis</em>? In this case, the subject is supplied
by the finite verb itself, and the slash arrow is therefore directed
towards the verb:</p> <img src="/assets/img/f6e5908f149e83318c2981e8d7b7dbc154ef967a.svg"><blockquote><p>Dixit eis respondens</p></blockquote> <p>This\topicword{Number of\outgoing\slashes\on XOBJs/XADVs} means that <em>every
node which is the daughter in an XOBJ or XADV relation should have a slash!</em>
The interpretation of the slash arrow is always uniform, since it is always a
<em>subject</em> dependent that these nodes lack. In other words, the slashee is aways
the subject of the slasher. Therefore there should <em>never be more than one</em>
outgoing slash from the daughter in an XOBJ or XADV relation, since this will
create an ambiguity. In other words, it is not possible to mark that such an
element shares an argument with another element of the sentence.</p> <p>Notice finally, that the slash arrow from an XOBJ or XADV node should
always be local, ie. directed towards either the head verb or an
element dominated by the head verb. This restriction is enforced by
the annotation interface. However, the annotation interface does allow
slashing into a dependent clause under the head verb. This should
<em>only</em> be done when the argument in question is a shared argument of
the main verb. Consider <em>tollens ergo membra Christi faciam membra
meretricis</em>. By section \ref{belong}, <em>membra Christi</em> is made
an object of tollens. However it is also shared as an object by
faciam. Therefore it is licit to slash from the object predicative
<em>membra meretricis</em> to <em>membra Christi</em>. However, in other
cases, where the argument of the dependent clause is not directly
shared by the main clause, we should not slash to it.</p> <h3 id="slashes-in-gapping-and-coordination"><a href="#slashes-in-gapping-and-coordination" class="header-anchor">#</a> Slashes in gapping and coordination</h3> <h4 id="motivation"><a href="#motivation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Motivation</h4> <p>Slashes in coordinate <em>sentences</em> denote much of the same

object daughter, <em>quod</em>, and <em>three</em> subject daughters, namely <em>edit</em>, <em>bibit</em></p> <ul><li>and <em>Caesar</em>. Although this ambiguity could be resolved through the
morphological annotation, we prefer to avoid it entirely and represent the
sentence as:</li></ul> <img src="/assets/img/1c9a274c80cd7827c23f511d70635a34e33a27c6.svg"><blockquote><p>quod Caesar edit et bibit bonum erat</p></blockquote> <h4 id="slashes-in-sentence-coordination"><a href="#slashes-in-sentence-coordination" class="header-anchor">#</a> Slashes in sentence coordination</h4> <p>Whenever \topicword{Shared\arguments}two coordinated sentences, or an
XADV and its main verb, share an element, be it a SUB, OBJ, XOBJ, OBL,
AG or ADV, and this element is overtly represented only once, the
element should be attached to the verb to which it belongs in the
surface string, and a slash arrow should be set from the other verb to
the shared element.</p> <p>Notice in particular \topicword{Treatment\of XADVs} that for the
purposes of slashing, XADVs are considered to be on par with their
governing verbs. It is allowed to slash from a main verb to an
argument of an XADV, but not to an argument of some dependent clause
(XOBJ, accusative with infinitive or subordinate clause). But the
opposite, a slash arrow from an XADV to an argument of the verb can
only indicate the subject of the XADV, therefore XADVs can only have
one outgoing slash arrow.</p> <p>This kind of slashes should leave a verbal node and point towards the
shared element. One should never use slashes between two verbs to
indicate subject identity.</p> <p>Consider again the first example from section \ref{sc}:</p> <img src="/assets/img/5802a38df1ea44f49b2e42c9c7c1ffff26fb60be.svg"><blockquote><p>Homo indebatur purpura et bysso et epulabatur cotidie</p></blockquote> <p>Now consider the example <em>qui uiuit et aurem habet, audiat</em>:</p> <img src="/assets/img/5b8f93f45ddbed6d8c9e312d6b8e245d3c458053.svg"><blockquote><p>qui vivit et aurem habet, audiat</p></blockquote> <p>The shared \topicword{Shared auxiliaries} element can also be an auxiliary verb:</p> <img src="/assets/img/43fd5ed2f1c7574d846fc8893d128e817ff61b5b.svg"><blockquote><p>multi autem sunt vocati, pauci vero electi</p></blockquote> <p>When\topicword{Interpretation\of slashes in\coordination} the slash
notation is used in sentence coordination, it is important to assure
that the grammatical relation between the slasher node and the slashee
is identical to the relation of the slashee to its mother. In other
words, if the slashee is a subject in its own clause, it should also
be the subject of the slasher. If the unexpressed object of a
coordinated verb is identical to the overt subject of another verb, we
cannot express this coreference relation.This is so because, unlike
the case of slash notation on open predications, where all slashees
are subjects, there is no default relation type with which to
interpret the slash relation. Instead, the slash relation 'inherits'
the function of the slashee node. As long as this restriction is
respected, there can be several slashes in a tree:</p> <img src="/assets/img/6347c417a7bbf8a11bc342ccfc21cc3d163ca3d9.svg"><blockquote><p>alii autem frondes  de arboribus et sternebant in via</p></blockquote> <p>We can even have many more arrows:</p> <img src="/assets/img/3c8e93300ef7866958f31373a844bb5b6893279d.svg"><blockquote><p>καὶ λαβόντες αὐτὸν ἔδειραν καὶ ἀπέστειλαν κενόν</p></blockquote> <p>Here, <em>αὐτὸν</em> is taken to be the overt object of
<em>λαβόντες</em> (for the general principle, see section
\ref{belong}). The arrows from <em>ἔδειραν</em> and
<em>ἀπέστειλαν</em> indicate that these verbs also have
<em>αὐτὸν</em> as their object. The arrows from <em>λαβόντες</em>
and <em>κενόν</em> to their respective dominating verbs
<em>ἔδειραν</em> and <em>ἀπέστειλαν</em> indicate that the
subjects of these XADVs is an unexpressed element which is 'supplied
by the verb'. In the case of <em>λαβόντες</em>, the subject of the
participle is the unexpressed subject of the main verb; and in the
case of <em>κενόν</em>, the subject of the adjective is the object
of the main verb. This object is expressed, but via a slash arrow: it
is therefore not possible to slash directly from <em>κενόν</em> to
its subject.</p> <h4 id="when-is-an-adverbial-shared"><a href="#when-is-an-adverbial-shared" class="header-anchor">#</a> When is an adverbial shared?</h4> <p>While it is generally easy to decide when two coordinated verbs share
their subject or another argument (object, oblique), it can be more
difficult to decide whether an adverbial actually has scope over both
conjuncts. Some are easy: for example, an adverbial conditional clause
is shared between two main clauses if they both belong to the apodosis
(if X, then Y and Z). Generally, time and space adverbials are the
most tricky ones: note in particular that time adverbials should only
be shared by two main clauses, if their events are cotemporal and not
consecutive.</p> <h4 id="slashes-in-gapping-multi-rooted-conjuncts"><a href="#slashes-in-gapping-multi-rooted-conjuncts" class="header-anchor">#</a> Slashes in gapping/multi-rooted conjuncts</h4> <p>\label{multislash}</p> <p>Slashes in multi-rooted conjuncts behave exactly like slashes in
sentence coordination, except that there is also a slash arrow from
the empty node representing the verb, to the overt verb.[^3] Consider
<em>tradet frater fratrem in mortem et pater filium</em>:</p> <img src="/assets/img/284fcf1c1fcc42b169de8e13d79faf2f40b9e718.svg"><blockquote><p>tradet frater fratrem in mortem et pater filium</p></blockquote> <p>As here, it is often the case that other elements than the predicate
are shared between the conjuncts. The slash arrow from the empty node
to <em>tradet</em> indicates predicate identity whereas the arrow from
the empty node to <em>in</em> indicates a shared argument. As such it
underlies the same restriction as other slashes in sentence
coordination: the slashee must have the same grammatical function in
both conjuncts.</p> <h4 id="in-which-conjunct-does-a-shared-element-belong"><a href="#in-which-conjunct-does-a-shared-element-belong" class="header-anchor">#</a> In which conjunct does a shared element belong?</h4> <p>\label{belong}</p> <p>Our treatment of shared arguments raises the question where a shared
argument belongs in the tree. Sometimes an element can belong in
several places. Why do we put <em>in mortem</em> in the first conjunct
in example \ref{mors}? Or, in a more difficult case, why does
<em>αὐτὸν</em> belong to <em>λαβόντες</em> in example
\ref{multiarrow}? The following section provides some guidelines for
making such decisions.</p> <p>For \topicword{Delimitation\of conjunct\domains} argument sharing
between coordinated elements we need to establish the domains of both
conjuncts. If there is an overt conjunction, this will indicate the
boundary between the two domains. Elements should therefore be made to
depend on the verb in their domain. In <em>tradet frater fratrem
in mortem et pater filium</em> we have the domains <em>tradet frater
fratrem in morten</em> and <em>pater filium</em>, so <em>in mortem</em>
clearly depends on <em>tradet</em> and not on the empty node. If there
is no overt conjunction, we appeal to the principle of domain
continuity: both domains should, if possible, be continuous. If there
are several possibilities, ambiguous elements should belong to the
first conjunct. For example, if there was no <em>et</em> in example
\ref{mors}, both <em>tradet frater fratrem in mortem // pater
filium</em> and <em>tradet frater fratrem // in mortem pater filium</em>
would yield continuous domains, so we choose the first option, which
attaches <em>in mortem</em> to the first conjunct.</p> <p>In practice, then, the principles mean that the first element which
belongs only to the second conjunct marks the start of the second
conjunct domain.</p> <p>When there is argument sharing between a clause and an XADV, the
principles remain the same, but the application is slightly
different. The subtree dominated by the subordinate verb or the
subjunction should correspond to a continuous string in the
sentence. In example \ref{multiarrow}, this means that
<em>αὐτὸν</em> can be attached to <em>λαβόντες</em>; if
<em>αὐτὸν</em> appeared to the right of <em>ἔδειραν</em>, such an
attachment would not be possible. When several attachments are
possible, we again choose to attach elements as early as possible in
the surface string: this means that we prefer to attach
<em>αὐτὸν</em> to <em>λαβόντες</em>. However, if the subject of
<em>ἔδειραν</em> intervened between <em>λαβόντες</em> and
<em>αὐτὸν</em>, such an attachment would <em>not</em> be possible,
since <em>λαβόντες αὐτὸν</em> would no longer be a continuous
domain.</p> <p>Notice, finally, that the principles described in this section are
only applicable whenever the sentence is ambiguous. Very often, case
morphology will make it entirely clear where an element belongs, and
in such cases, the morphology should not be overridden by
considerations of domain continuity etc.</p> <p>[^1] Ie. the node where the slash is inserted; the origin of the slash arrow in the visual representation of the dependency tree.
[^2] Ie. the goal of the slash arrow in the visual representation of the dependency tree.
[^3] This slash arrow therefore has a different interpretation, meaning that the slasher node has the same meaning as the slashee node.</p> <h2 id="other-constructions"><a href="#other-constructions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Other constructions</h2> <h3 id="all-self-and-similar-words"><a href="#all-self-and-similar-words" class="header-anchor">#</a> 'all', 'self' and similar words</h3> <p>Words like 'all', 'self' and a few others are special: they are not really
pronouns with anaphoric reference, but they behave very similarly when
they determine non-overt ('pro-dropped') subjects as in:</p> <blockquote><p>At <em>illi</em> ut viderunt eum ambulantem super mare putaverunt fantasma esse et exclamaverunt. <em>Omnes</em> enim eum viderunt et conturbati sunt.</p> <p>'But as <em>they</em> saw him walk on the see, they thought it was a spirit and cried out. For <em>they all</em> saw him and were terrified.' (Mark 6.50)</p></blockquote> <p><em>omnes</em> does not refer to the same referent as <em>illi</em>, but
rather quantifies over this referent. However, this is difficult to
represent in a syntax without empty nominal elements. Instead we have
opted to take <em>omnes</em> as the subject in such cases. The same holds for
<em>ipse</em> 'self' in cases like the following:</p> <img src="/assets/img/799d9bcf0a5e7bb5b619d83d6ee97efb13f259e8.svg"><blockquote><p>ipse autem dixit illis</p> <p>'He himself told them'</p></blockquote> <p>With <em>ipse</em> there is the added complication, however, that <em>ipse</em> (just
like Greek <em>αὐτός</em> which it translates) sometimes means 'self' and
sometimes is used as a pure anaphoric pronoun 'he'. This difference in
meaning (which is necessarily subjective) is rendered in the morphology:
when the meaning is 'self' we make it a demonstrative pronoun, and when it
is 'he' we make it a personal pronoun.</p> <p>In effect, this means that we take intensifiers and quantifiers as
subjects when they really are not. This leads to some complications
whenever the intensifier/quantifier appears in an open predication,
i.e.\ a structure which should not have a subject:</p> <img src="/assets/img/5b6061cdcf5fc528b500891ba428dad5a40df720.svg"><p>When interpreting such structures, it should be born in mind that 'self'

<em>ἦν διδάσκων</em>) or modal auxiliary + some infinite form, two
analyses are in principle possible: a biclausal one where the finite
copula/auxiliary is the head and the lexical verb is an XOBJ
dependent; or a monoclausal analysis where the infinite lexical verb
is the head, and the copula/auxiliary verb is an Aux-dependent.</p> <p>The two analyses correspond to different degrees of grammaticalization
of the constructions. We have decided to treat the following cases as
monoclausal ones (ie. the finite verb is an aux and not the head):</p> <ul><li><p>Latin passives, future infinitives and the periphrastic conjugation</p></li> <li><p>Slavic periphrastic perfects (<em>l</em>-participles)</p></li> <li><p>The Greek periphrastic passive perfect</p></li></ul> <p>In all other cases, we take the finite verb to be the main PRED.

such cases, temporal and local adverbials should be dependents on the
finite verbs, whereas arguments and event modifiers like instrumentals
should depend on lexical verb.</p> <h3 id="comparison"><a href="#comparison" class="header-anchor">#</a> Comparison</h3> <p>Ablatives of comparison in Latin, and the similar genitives of
comparison in Greek and Old Church Slavonic, are dependent on the
comparative adjective via OBL:</p> <img src="/assets/img/cdf6f536ccf0c4fb6de5a55d1bbe35b58ab6d5b7.svg"><blockquote><p>luce sunt clariora nobis tua consilia omnia</p> <p>'Your plans are clearer than light for us'</p></blockquote> <p>When <em>quam</em> is used it should depend on the comparative
adjective via OBL, and the second member should depend on
<em>quam</em> via the same relation as the other item compared:</p> <img src="/assets/img/60be445504a242cc02c48cf3ef021dd1f48ee01f.svg"><blockquote><p>puella est laetior quam puer</p></blockquote> <p>OCS неже behaves in the same way, and should have the same analysis.</p> <p>Other expressions of comparison are analysed in the same way:
<em>nihil aliud nisi</em>, <em>idem qui</em>, <em>similis ac</em>
etc. Here is an example:</p> <img src="/assets/img/e1d934c14c619d5ae3ecd65feee6b8c657a396e5.svg"><blockquote><p>Caesarem non eadem quae me sensisse scio</p></blockquote> <p>We use the same principle for comparative adverbs.</p> <img src="/assets/img/efcd5a34d3c3698ba04abf61c24048541be0c304.svg"><blockquote><p>Brutus amat Caesarem plus quam Augustum</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/0d18dcf1de848b000ed5e91cbbf67740fb31a677.svg"><blockquote><p>Brutus amat Caesarem plus quam Augustus</p></blockquote> <p>This approach is tantamount to treating <em>quam</em> (as well as <em>nisi</em> in <em>nihil aliud nisi</em>, <em>qui</em> in <em>idem qui</em>, <em>ac</em> in <em>similis ac</em>) as introducing a sentence.</p> <p>Here is another example where <em>nisi</em> modifies an interrogative pronoun:</p> <img src="/assets/img/f47f2719d23a9c496a79fde45f9f2b8a4366c394.svg"><blockquote><p>quis potest dimittere peccata nisi solus Deus</p> <p>'Who but God alone can forgive sins'</p></blockquote> <p>If there is no 'antecedent' to <em>nisi</em>, it will bear a sentence-level function:</p> <img src="/assets/img/9a6c1a8e4736975d40525bd549b992ffb425033d.svg"><blockquote><p>manducavit panes quos non licet manducare nisi sacerdotibus</p></blockquote> <p>Words that mean 'as' (such as Greek <em>ὡς</em>, OCS ѣко, Latin
<em>velut</em> and Gothic <em>swa</em>) are treated in the same way. On the
sentence level they are often adverbs (as in the following example)
or predicative complements (\ref{velutpredcomp}):</p> <img src="/assets/img/1ea44e8ae9257ecab4d4f32a6bd01dafe99aaff5.svg"><img src="/assets/img/b56125feacefbd2532fdc01bdaad53edd0a7798b.svg"><blockquote><p>Homines erant sicut oves non habentes pastorem</p> <p>'People are like sheep without a shepherd'</p></blockquote> <p>Note that the adverbs of comparison are often used to introduce object
predicatives as well. Here the comparison analysis does not work,
since the implicit verb of the predicative is the copula, not the main
verb. E.g. <em>fac me sicut unum de mercennariis tuis</em> does not mean
'Make me as (you make) one of your hirelings', but rather 'Make me be
one of your hirelings'.</p> <h3 id="verbs-of-preference"><a href="#verbs-of-preference" class="header-anchor">#</a> Verbs of preference</h3> <p>Latin in particular has some 'comparative' verbs, like <em>malo</em> 'prefer
something to something', or <em>expedit</em> 'it is better that something than
that something'. The first sentence in the comparison is assigned the
COMP or XOBJ relation, depending on whether it has an internal subject
or not. The second element is typically introduced by (the adverb) <em>quam</em>,
which becomes an OBL under <em>malo</em>, <em>expedit</em>, and invariably introduces
a COMP, even if the first comparandum is an XOBJ, see \corref{53182}.</p> <h3 id="approximately"><a href="#approximately" class="header-anchor">#</a> 'Approximately'</h3> <p>The idea 'approximately' is often expressed by words like ὡς and ѣко,
which are then taken as AUX'es. In Slavic this is always an AUX on the
numeral, if there is one, whereas in the other languages we try to put it
on the the head of the phrase being modified:</p> <img src="/assets/img/954afc4347cc68ee005b9a2c423e5089c28b251d.svg"><img src="/assets/img/f45ebf0cfba5dcb2a58809763226409ed4b5cc1b.svg"><p>The situation in Gothic and Latin is unresolved.</p> <h3 id="coordination-through-particles-in-greek"><a href="#coordination-through-particles-in-greek" class="header-anchor">#</a> Coordination through particles in Greek</h3> <p>We adopt a very restrictive view of conjunctions: basically only words
that can conjoin two words into a phrase, or two sentences into one,
count as conjunctions. Particles like <em>μὲν...δὲ...</em> are not treated as conjunctions: instead we treat
this as asyndetic coordination, using an empty conjunction and leaving
<em>μὲν</em> and <em>δὲ</em> as Aux-dependents on their respective
conjuncts.</p> <p>In a sequence <em>τε...καί</em> we treat
<em>καί</em> as the head and <em>τε</em> as an auxiliary
particle.</p> <h3 id="scope"><a href="#scope" class="header-anchor">#</a> Scope</h3> <p>\label{scope}</p> <p>Scope is relevant to many constructions. An adjective can modify one
or more nouns, and is then said to have scope over these nouns. A
genitive can be dependent upon (and thereby for example modify) one or
more nouns. The negation can negate one particular element in a
sentence, or several, or the whole sentence - these elements are said
to be in the scope of the negation. Emphasizing particles can take
scope of one or more words.</p> <p>We represent scope via the attachment site of scoping items. Scoping
items should be placed so as to be dependent on the item in their
scope. By default, they also take scope over all elements dominated by
their mother node; so a negation dependent on the verb negates the
whole sentence. This means that if we want an item to take scope over
two coordinated elements, it should be made to depend on the
conjunction. However, since the status of the Greek definite article
regarding whether it can take scope over two coordinated proper nouns
is completely unclear, we currently make it a dependent of the
following noun only - in other words, the article is never attached to
a conjunction.</p> <p>If e.g. a negation has scope over only one of two coordinated
elements, it must be attached to that element. Note that this holds
even in cases of double negation, i.e. a negation may be an AUX on a
negative pronoun. In OCS, consequently, a pronoun may end up having
both a negative particle and a negation as AUXes, such as in
\corref{36606}, where the negation has scope over only one of two
coordinated OBJs.</p> <p>Notice that we do take <em>ni manna</em> as grammaticalized in the
meaning 'noone', which means that <em>ni</em> is taken a dependent on
<em>manna</em>.</p> <p>It is often difficult to determine the correct scope of time and space
adverbials, especially when they co-occur with participles or subordinate
clauses at the beginning of the sentence.</p> <img src="/assets/img/3a1848829cdc3fca20a37dba831a16fd10541451.svg"><blockquote><p>surgens autem de synagoga introivit in domum Simonis</p> <p>'And having risen out of the synagogue, he entered into the house of Simon'</p></blockquote> <p><em>autem</em> is here made dependent on the main verb, but <em>de
synagoga</em> on <em>surgens</em>: Our guiding principles is to mark such
adverbials as ADVs on the main PRED unless their scope is clearly only
over a participle (XADV) or a subordinate clause. In this way, the
default solution is to give time and space adverbials maximal scope
within the sentence.</p> <p>Note however that scope over coordinated verbs/sentences is treated in
a fundamentally different way. An item which is the subject of two
coordinated verbs can <em>not</em> be made dependent on the
conjunction. Instead, it should depend on the verb in the sentence
where it appears (see section \ref{belong} for delimitation of the
domains) and have an incoming slash arrow from the verb in the second
conjunct.</p> <h3 id="impersonal-verbs"><a href="#impersonal-verbs" class="header-anchor">#</a> Impersonal verbs</h3> <p>\label{impers}</p> <p>Impersonal verbs are defined by their inability to take a
subject. Therefore, verbs like <em>licet</em>, <em>pudet</em>
\scriptgr{'{e}xestin} etc. should never take a subject
dependent. Infinitives with such verbs should be considered COMPs or
XOBJs, depending on whether an accusative subject would be possible or
not. For example <em>licet</em> takes a dative and an infinitive. This
becomes:</p> <img src="/assets/img/07f805bc4c5329e20dbbacbd259c6aa9e8532f2a.svg"><blockquote><p>licet viro dimittere uxorem</p></blockquote> <p>This means that whenever no dative is present, there should be a slash to the main verb:</p> <img src="/assets/img/5c3d8489d10b7d5cabd99a1ea8dd7c07b89780d8.svg"><blockquote><p>oportet fieri</p></blockquote> <p>On the other hand, such verbs can often also be constructed with an
Accusative with infinitive, and in such cases, they must be COMPs:</p> <img src="/assets/img/6bef5ec10bc95fddb18aeff928672d878ebe9400.svg"><blockquote><p>in omnes gentes oportet praedicari evangelium</p></blockquote> <p>Verbs which are sometimes constructed with an AcI and sometimes with a
pure infintive are ambiguous whenever there is no subject accusative
to the infinitive and no argument of the main verb which can supply a
subject to the infinitive. In such cases, annotators should choose the
XOBJ relation, as in example \ref{imperswosubject}. But first it must
be made sure that the verb in question can take a pure infinitive.</p> <h3 id="esse-participle"><a href="#esse-participle" class="header-anchor">#</a> esse + participle</h3> <p>In the New Testament, we fairly often find a construction where the
copula combines with a participle to form something which could almost
be described as a periphrastic form. However, despite the regularity
of the construction, we have chosen to treat it as if the copula had
its full force:</p> <img src="/assets/img/60d306ba24f6a16dd30debf1778061bcd92447b6.svg"><blockquote><p>erat docens</p></blockquote> <p>We use the same analysis for this construction in the other languages.</p> <h3 id="gerunds"><a href="#gerunds" class="header-anchor">#</a> Gerunds</h3> <p>\label{gerunds}</p> <p>Gerunds on verbal nouns which cannot take a subject. As such, they
should have an outgoing slash arrow. Gerunds on their own will very
often be XADVs, fulfilling an adverbial role in the sentence. This
goes both for instrumental ablative gerunds and final genitive
gerunds:</p> <img src="/assets/img/075e7ab0e78d1175caf1906e4cc1ee7305c748d2.svg"><blockquote><p>qui habet aures audiendi, audiat</p></blockquote> <p>However, gerunds are also very often embedded in a preposition
phrase. In such cases, the preposition serves as an ADV, while the
gerund is an OBL of the preposition with a slash to its subject:</p> <img src="/assets/img/45d5aaa37529163c20a59bb7cb439202f7d406ac.svg"><blockquote><p>discipuli in remigando laborant</p></blockquote> <p>Another common use of gerunds is as arguments of certain verbal nouns,
as in e.g. <em>spes vincendi</em>. In this function, they are NARGs,
but with a slash to the subject if one is present. This slash should
be directed towards the nearest possible subject - the number of nodes
one must go upwards from the NARG/OBL slasher node before one descends
towards the slashee node should be as small as possible.</p> <p>Ablative gerunds are also typically ADVs:</p> <img src="/assets/img/cd95e6ccc3da63b0524ee08ace2b9ee73432e169.svg"><blockquote><p>gutta cavat lapidem non vi sed saepe cadendo</p></blockquote> <h3 id="infinitives"><a href="#infinitives" class="header-anchor">#</a> Infinitives</h3> <p>\label{infinitives}</p> <p>The two most common functions of (non-articular) infinitives are head
of AcI (which is a COMP) and complement of auxiliary verb (XOBJ). But
infinitives can have other functions, often corresponding to that of
the gerund in Latin. For example, a bare infinitive can express
purpose, in which case it is an XADV. It can also be an argument of a
noun, in which case it is a NARG. The articular infinitive can be the
object of a preposition, in which case it is an OBL. XADVs and XOBJs
underlie some restriction on their slashes, which should always be
'local', ie. point toward the mother node or a node which the mother
node dominates. Slashes from NARGs and OBLs are freer, but should
still be as local as possible - the number of nodes one must go
upwards from the NARG/OBL slasher node before one descends towards the
slashee node should be as small as possible.</p> <img src="/assets/img/b513ef070e6fe3e09467c1665d3dab1a8573090f.svg"><blockquote><p>ἔχει χρείαν νίψασθαι</p></blockquote> <p>The subject of <em>νίψασθαι</em> is not represented directly, but is
coreferent with the subject of <em>ἔχει</em>. If this subject was
present in the sentence, the coreference would again be noted by means
of the slash notation.</p> <p>Furthermore, infinitives are often found in positions where it could
be analysed as a subject. However, we have chosen to treat it as a
COMP 'across the board', in order to avoid complicated choices:</p> <img src="/assets/img/b9c1186c66f3e88972e87bf953b1d13e048d8b00.svg"><blockquote><p>dulce et decorum est pro patria mori</p></blockquote> <h3 id="ocs-reflexives"><a href="#ocs-reflexives" class="header-anchor">#</a> OCS reflexives</h3> <p>Note that the reflexive marker with OCS and Gothic reflexive verbs is

corpus. In Greek and Gothic, for example, the instrumental and the
dative have syncretized.  Therefore the dative has a variety of
instrumental meanings which are almost always ADVs, except with some
verbs like <em>χράομαι</em> 'use' which takes a dative OBL.</p> <p>In this section, we focus particularly on the 'dative proper',
excluding meanings that have arisen by syncretism.  The proper dative
has as its central meaning the expression of 'the more remotely
concerned person'. This will most often be an OBL. However, there are
some other possibilities.</p> <p>Note that it is not always easy to determine whether a dative-marked
nominal is adverbal or adnominal, particularly in constructions which
can be perceived as predicative possession:</p> <img src="/assets/img/09bdacc5e6478d2bfd021383462e253327e9b89e.svg"><img src="/assets/img/65d873e2c0644c901ca17e6fd3eaa4e819fb8a9f.svg"><img src="/assets/img/c373cbccb580bcfe09628c4e5c68d66c6fe111a8.svg"><p>Our rule of thumb is that if the construction contains a (possibly
null) copula and can be perceived as a predicative possessive
construction (as in (\ref{name1}) and (\ref{name2}), see section
\ref{subsec:copula} for more), the dative should be considered an OBL
on the verb.</p> <p>In other such constructions (e.g.\ \ref{money}), the dative should be
considered an adnominal ATR if the verb is <em>not</em> the copula, or if
the construction is <em>not</em> possessive. The reason for this rule is
that the class of dative ATRs is so much smaller than the class of
dative OBLs contained in ditransitive constructions and possessive
constructions, and thus they are also easier to tease apart manually.</p> <p>In other adnominal uses, the dative can be a NARG, whereas the
so-called ethical dative should be ADV. This is our general usage
whenever we have copula + adjective + dative: <em>bonum esse alicui</em>
and similar constructions.</p> <h3 id="compound-subjunctions"><a href="#compound-subjunctions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Compound subjunctions</h3> <p>In Biblical Greek, there are some 'compound subjunctions' like
<em>ἕως ὅτου</em>/<em>οὗ</em> and <em>πρὶν ἢ</em>. In such
cases, we take the main word <em>ἕως</em> or <em>πρὶν</em> to be
the the real subjunction, mostly bearing an ADV relation to the
governing verb and being the PRED head of a subordinated verb, whereas
the accompanying element <em>ὅτου</em>, <em>οὗ</em>, <em>ἢ</em> is an AUX dependent
on it. We also treat <em>ἄχρι οὗ</em> the same way. Gothic <em>\th{}izei</em>
is also done the same way, \corref{52365}.</p> <p>Latin <em>eo quod</em> and <em>propterea quod</em>, on the other hand, is not taken as a compound
subjunction: rather, <em>eo, propterea</em> gets its function in the main clause
(mostly ADV), and the clause introduced by <em>quod</em> is an apposition
on it. <em>und þatei</em> in Gothic is treated the same way, since
<em>quod</em> and <em>þatei</em> are subjunctions.</p> <h3 id="appositive-names-καλουμενος-ονοματι-etc"><a href="#appositive-names-καλουμενος-ονοματι-etc" class="header-anchor">#</a> Appositive names: <em>καλούμενος</em>, <em>ὀνόματι</em> etc.</h3> <p>Names can be expressed as appositions, which sometimes occur by

<em>καλούμενος</em> (as an ATR or APOS, see below) in the
appropriate case. When it is not introduced by <em>καλούμενος</em>
or a similar verb, it is is simply an apposition to its noun,
eventually with <em>ὀνόματι</em> as its own attribute:</p> <img src="/assets/img/3416a7b5f04c7d7d25d459e5613a87eadc2f7f5e.svg"><blockquote><p>ἔρχεται εἷς τῶν ἀρχισυναγώγων, ὀνόματι Ἰάειρος</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/b30f60317b3acf1a521ec715ff79fe421a7b6c83.svg"><blockquote><p>ἤλθομεν εἰς τόπον τινὰ καλούμενον Καλοὺς λιμένας</p></blockquote> <p>Here <em>καλούμενος</em> is an ATR because it determines the

XOBJ in both cases. It should be stressed, though, that this
analysis is purely conventional and does not carry over to other
location verbs, like <em>stare</em>, <em>maneo</em> etc. which takes a
preposition phrase as an OBL.</p> <p><em>esse</em> and similar verbs can also have existential force,
meaning 'there exists'. In such cases, if there is a preposition
phrase or another locative expression present, it will be an ADV, and
the sentence means 'There were X in Y.'</p> <p>The copula verb is typically also used in predicative possessive
constructions like <em>liber est mihi</em> 'I have a book'. The dative is
here considered an OBL dependent of the verb. In possessive
constructions there is often no XOBJ, but sometimes -- particularly in
some naming constructions like <em>nomen alicui esse X</em> -- we have
both SUB, XOBJ and OBL. Such constructions express that the subject
referent 'belongs to' (in a wide sense) the referent of the oblique.</p> <h3 id="vocatives"><a href="#vocatives" class="header-anchor">#</a> Vocatives</h3> <p>It is easy to think that all morphological vocatives will have the
relation VOC, but annotators should note that there are other
possibilities. First, and most obvious, vocative nouns and adjectives
can be ATR or APOS under another vocative.</p> <p>But there are other possibilites. In <em>Οὐ πᾶς ὁ λέγων μοι
κύριε κύριε εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τῶν οὐρανῶν</em>, f.ex.,
<em>κύριε κύριε</em> will be an OBJ of <em>λέγων</em>. In
<em>Τί δέ με καλεῖτε κύριε κύριε</em>, <em>κύριε</em> is an
XOBJ (with a slash to <em>με</em>).</p> <h3 id="and-it-came-to-pass"><a href="#and-it-came-to-pass" class="header-anchor">#</a> And it came to pass...</h3> <p>Narrative sequences are often introduced by <em>ἐγένετο</em>,
<em>factum est autem</em> or similar expressions. These are sometimes
followed by a substantival clause (<em>ὅτι</em>, <em>ut</em>) which
is clearly a COMP dependent of <em>ἐγένετο</em>/<em>factum</em>
Often, however, the subjunction is lacking. We still treat these
sentences as COMP dependents, no different from other substantival
clauses without subjunction:</p> <img src="/assets/img/2854c480d3c7cc46224a2ff49359dbcfe64fe1a5.svg"><p>However, we sometimes find _factum est...et..._V.

often also a verb of position ('John is in London') and a verb of
existence ('There are doctors in London'). We do not attempt to keep
the first two apart: both complements ('a doctor') and ('in London')
are considered XOBJs. But the existence verb is treated
differently: here there is in fact no complement, only an adverbial:</p> <img src="/assets/img/9986a47001c29585014c19415a10d4e1736d0c47.svg"><blockquote><p>erant autem in ecclesia propheta et doctores</p></blockquote> <p>If in doubt, annotators should ask themselves whether a translation by
'there is/are' is possible in English, in which case the verb should
be treated as a verb of existence.</p> <h3 id="gothic-sa"><a href="#gothic-sa" class="header-anchor">#</a> Gothic <em>sa</em></h3> <p>Gothic <em>sa</em> shows the syntactic behaviour of a demonstrative
pronoun/adjective, but can also be used as a pure substitute for the
Greek article.  We try to capture this distinction by giving
<em>sa</em> the Aux-relation whenever it functions as a mere article;
when it has full deictic force, on the other hand, it will typically
be an ATR-dependent of a noun, or bear a nominal function itself. The
first example shows <em>sa</em> as an article, the second <em>sa</em>
as a demonstrative pronoun:</p> <img src="/assets/img/997229d2b6c9efbac0c7847decad254fd2d520f0.svg"><blockquote><p>\th{}is audagins gu\th{}s</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/914123c00373ddd92524157a20c30ef10fccc35b.svg"><blockquote><p>sildaleikidedun ana þamma</p></blockquote> <p>Note that just like the Greek article which it serves to translate,
Gothic <em>sa</em> can be used to nominalize adverbs or prepositions,
in which case it is made an Aux-dependent on the head of the adverbial
element:</p> <img src="/assets/img/5ff0acff63996339c4978df947f2dd96249ae430.svg"><blockquote><p>attan izwarana \th{}ana in himinam</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/85f99c078cb704a14aeff2bd0b4b8e64758881d1.svg"><blockquote><p>fram himma nu</p></blockquote> <p>It can often be hard to decide whether <em>sa</em> in a given context
passage has demonstrative force or not. Annotators should ask
themselves whether <em>this</em>/<em>that</em> or <em>the</em> is the
best translation.</p> <h3 id="pleonastic-αυτος-resumptive-pronouns-and-topicalizations"><a href="#pleonastic-αυτος-resumptive-pronouns-and-topicalizations" class="header-anchor">#</a> 'Pleonastic' <em>αὐτός</em> -- resumptive pronouns and topicalizations</h3> <p>\label{resumtopic}</p> <p>In many cases, Greek (and sometimes the translations) have a
pleonastic <em>αὐτός</em> which picks up the reference of a full

pronouns: <em>αὐτός</em> gets the grammatical function, and the

clause; it should get the grammatical function, and the relative
pronoun should be an APOS on it.</p> <p>More common, however, are the cases where we get a fronted relative
clause which is picked up by an <em>αὐτός</em> in the main
clause. We analyse these as non-restrictive relative clauses on
<em>αὐτός</em>:</p> <img src="/assets/img/0b39e58a27f9d42a2c3557b482c137817d419493.svg"><p>The same analysis is used whenever the fronted constituent is not a

absolutive constructions are sometimes introduced by <em>at</em> and
<em>du</em>. These are taken as aux-dependents of the verbal head of
the construction:</p> <img src="/assets/img/cee4db5282d81eca7837313d3be03c8fb9106078.svg"><p>Exactly analogous is the treatment of <em>at</em> + absolutive
construction e.g. in \corref{37757}. Note that when there is only one
<em>du</em>, but two coordinated infinitives, we take <em>du</em> as a
dependent on the closest infinitive only, cf. \corref{37500}. Since
infinitives can occur without <em>du</em>, and since it is not possible
to decide whether <em>du</em> also belongs to the other infinitive, this
is in a sense the minimal claim.</p> <h3 id="aux-on-pronouns-ocs-иже-аще"><a href="#aux-on-pronouns-ocs-иже-аще" class="header-anchor">#</a> AUX on pronouns -- OCS иже аще</h3> <p>In OCS, аще converts relative pronouns into indefinite relative
pronouns, such as in \corref{36505}. In these cases, аще should
be analysed as a non-comparable adverb morphologically and as an AUX
directly on the pronoun. In the Greek counterpart sentences, however,
<em>ἂν</em> is considered to have sentence scope and should
therefore be an AUX on the verb, as in \corref{6652}.</p> <h3 id="adnominal-infinitives"><a href="#adnominal-infinitives" class="header-anchor">#</a> Adnominal infinitives</h3> <p>\label{adnominf}</p> <p>In several cases, infinitives modify nominal forms like pronouns,
adjectives and nouns, as in 'easy to read', 'something to eat' etc. We
treat such infinitives as <em>modifiers</em> since it tells us
<em>in what respect</em> something is easy and <em>what kind</em> of
something we are talking about.</p> <p>Dependents on pronouns and nouns therefore often become ATRs:</p> <img src="/assets/img/f3ae6763e844ee9fc7102a748c11a8b8afc7d6ae.svg"><p>Dependents of adjectives is a somewhat more complicated matter: many
adjectives such as <em>dignus</em>, <em>ἄξιος</em>
etc. <em>require</em> an infinitive or a subordinate clause. The
infinitive therefore becomes an OBL, or a COMP if it is a full
accusative with infinitive construction:</p> <img src="/assets/img/2e60ad2c023839cd003d52d4608aef437f7fcbf0.svg"><p>But note that adjectives also can take infinitives that are ADVs, such

<em>cum nona hora esset</em> we take the temporal expression to be a
XOBJ, since the construction is impersonal the time is not
predicated of something, but currently the system enforces that all
open relations have a slash, so there should be a slash to the copula.</p> <p>However, we sometimes get <em>hora</em> combined with something which cannot readily be an attributive modifier, such as <em>hora est vespera</em>.

the subjunction the meaning would be 'not if'. The particle should
belong to the main clause.</p> <p>Latin uses <em>alioquin</em> and Gothic <em>ai\th\th{}au</em> for this. Both

different cases to distinguish:</p> <ul><li><p>COMP and OBJ are coordinated</p></li> <li><p>the OBJ is co-referent with the subject of the COMP</p></li></ul> <p>In the first case, the COMP and the OBJ should simply be coordinated
and the coordinating node should be given the OBJ relation:</p> <img src="/assets/img/4cd6d5e132dec42ddc819edb8a2d52df477439a8.svg"><blockquote><p>viderunt mulieres monumentum et quemadmodum positum erat corpus eius</p> <p>'The women beheld the sepulchre and how his body was laid.'</p></blockquote> <p>But in most cases where the object is coreferent with the subject of
the COMP we have a different construction ('prolepsis' in traditional
grammar) and here we make both the OBJ and the COMP directly dependent
on the verb without any coordination:</p> <img src="/assets/img/da0d87c62935cb7289fccef4cd6c6dd70ac5e1e7.svg"><blockquote><p>Scio te qui sis</p> <p>'I know who you are'</p></blockquote> <p>It seems characteristic of these constructions that the object is not
really a thematic argument of the verb, but just anticipates the
subject of the complement clause.</p> <h3 id="questions-with-alternatives"><a href="#questions-with-alternatives" class="header-anchor">#</a> Questions with alternatives</h3> <p>Sometimes a question is asked with alternatives to choose between, as
in 'Who is the better one, me or my brother?'.

ADV or an OBL, or -- in more traditional terms -- whether an element
is an adjunct or an argument. Therefore we provide a super-tag which
should be used whenever the annotator cannot decide, but the following
section offers some advice to guide the choice.</p> <p><em>Arguments</em> are traditionally defined as 'elements seen as required by the
verb'. In old Indo-European languages, nothing is really 'required by the
verb', because all elements, even subjects and objects, can be dropped if they
are easily inferable from the context. The test is therefore not whether an
element can be left out or not, but rather whether it is possible to
conceptualize the event expressed by the verb while abstracting from some
element in the sentence. If that is possible, the element is an adjunct.
Adjuncts (ADVs) are elements which elaborate upon an event desription and gives
extra information about the event.</p> <p>There are some kinds of adverbials which are almost always
adjuncts. These are</p> <ul><li><p>Adverbials of manner</p></li> <li><p>Adverbials of instrument</p></li> <li><p>Adverbials of time</p></li> <li><p>Adverbials of place</p></li> <li><p>Adverbials of purpose</p></li></ul> <p>But even here there are exceptions: in <em>bene tractare</em>, for
example, <em>bene</em> is an argument, since it is not possible to
conceptualize the idea of 'treating someone' while abstracting away
from the way of treating him. <em>utor</em> + ablative in Latin, and
\scriptgr{qr'{a}omai} + dative in Greek are cases where an adverbial
of instrument has been grammaticalized so as to become a
ablative/dative ''object'' - which we treat as an OBL. Place
adverbials are typically OBLs and not ADVs when they appear with
'positional verbs', such as <em>stare, sedere</em> etc. However, even
these can sometimes take a position ADV. Consider the following
interesting example:</p> <img src="/assets/img/2a369bb07a38f6419eeea107842db41247d6d23e.svg"><blockquote><p>in synagogis sedebant in cathedris primis</p></blockquote> <p>The <em>cathedris</em>, seats, are inextricably linked to the sitting
event, but the synagogues are not.</p> <p>Elements of an idiom will also often be OBLs, e.g. <em>cum</em> in
<em>pacem facere cum aliquo</em>. some more</p> <p>There is also another way of thinking about arguments: they are
elements that can appear in a sentence because of the main
verb. Specifications on manner, instruments, times and places can
appear with almost any verb. Specifications of goal and source, on the
other hand, can only appear with a subset of verbs - mostly motion
verbs - therefore they are arguments of their verbs. Sometimes both a
source and a goal appears in a sentence, and both are OBLs:</p> <img src="/assets/img/d5b03c6d3a69e69eda1fe414f452cd5cd2b83f52.svg"><blockquote><p>ἤρχοντο πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντοθεν</p></blockquote> <p>The two ways of thinking about arguments do not always give the same
predictions. Here for example, one could argue that it is possible to
conceptualize motion without a goal and a source; but goal and source
are 'selected' by the verb and cannot appear with any verb.</p> <p>If the two tests give the same result, we have a rather clear case of
an argument. But most elements which test positively for argumenthood
in either one should be considered arguments.</p> <h3 id="atr-or-apos-attribute-or-apposition"><a href="#atr-or-apos-attribute-or-apposition" class="header-anchor">#</a> ATR or APOS? attribute or apposition?</h3> <p>\ldots</p> <h3 id="atr-or-xadv"><a href="#atr-or-xadv" class="header-anchor">#</a> ATR or XADV?</h3> <p>Adjectives and participles (and other adjective-like categories) can
be attributive or predicative/conjunct. In the first case it helps
determine the reference of the noun phrase; in the second case, it is
a predication which expresses an event or a state which 'accompanies'
the main event and which takes the noun as its subject. Thus, example
\ref{gauls} has two readings: 'The happy Gauls (as opposed to
f.ex. the sad ones) entered the camp', with a restrictive adjective
which should be an ATR, and 'The Gauls, being happy, entered the
camp', where the adjective does not restrict the group of Gauls, but
rather describes a state which coincides with the main event. It is
generally the case that attributive adjectives/participles can be
rendered by a restrictive relative clause ('The Gauls who were happy
entered the camp.') and predicative ones by non-restrictive relative
clauses or even adverbial clauses: 'The Gauls, who were happy, entered
the camp.'</p> <p>It can sometimes be hard to know whether a participle or an adjective
is an ATR or an XADV, ie. whether it helps determine the reference of
the noun (ATR) or is predicated of the noun (XADV).</p> <p>With definite noun phrases, the decision is easier to make than with
indefinite nouns. In Greek there is overt marking:
participles/adjectives in attributive position (directly after the
article) are ATRs and participles/adjectives in predicative position
are XADVs. But note that not all adnominal elements follow the
standard rules; for example <em>πᾶς</em> regularly appears in
predicative position even when it is attributive.</p> <p>Even in languages with no overt marking of the attributive/predicative
opposition or of the definite/indefinite opposition, it is generally
easier to determine whether an item is an ATR or an XADV if the NP is
semantically definite. This is so because the NP in such cases has a
definite referent, and we can easily determine whether the
adjective/participle helps picking out this referent.</p> <p>With indefinites, this is more difficult to determine. Annotators can
try whether it is possible to paraphrase a participle or adjective by
a non-restrictive relative clause - if so, the participle/adjective is
likely an XADV. Another test is whether it is possible to set up a
contrasting referent - if so, the participle/adjective is likely an
ATR.</p> <h3 id="xadv-or-sub"><a href="#xadv-or-sub" class="header-anchor">#</a> XADV or SUB?</h3> <p>A similar question arises whenever a participle is dependent on a verb without
there being an overt subject present, as in <em>venientes dicunt ei</em>. If
<em>venientes</em> is taken as the subject, the sentence means 'those who are coming
say to him'. If <em>venientes</em> is taken as an XADV, it means 'Coming (to him),
they said to him'. There are no clear tests to be used. Annotators should base
their analysis on a semantic interpretation of the sentence.</p> <h3 id="more-on-the-xobj-relation"><a href="#more-on-the-xobj-relation" class="header-anchor">#</a> More on the XOBJ relation</h3> <p>\label{morexobj}</p> <p>The XADV and XOBJ relations are unfamiliar from traditional school
grammar. XADV corresponds quite closely to the concept of
predicative/conjunct participle or adjective, so it should not be too
hard to grasp. The XOBJ relation, on the other hand, does not
correspond closely to one particular category of traditional grammar,
so it needs further explanation.</p> <p>The crucial facts to grasp about the XOBJ relation is that it is used
for predications which have external subjects (whence the 😆 and
which are governed by another verb. This means that nothing which can
itself have a subject daughter, is an XOBJ: all finite verbs are
excluded.</p> <p>The prototypical XOBJ is therefore an infinite verbal form, but other
word classes can also be predicative: most notably nouns, adjectives
and prepositions.</p> <p>XOBJ is a governed relation, an element which is selected and demanded
by the matrix verb. A prototypical case are auxiliary verbs, like
<em>posse</em>, <em>coepi</em>, <em>velle</em> and others, which demand a complement
infinitive (and this infinitive cannot take its own subject). However,
other verbs can also take an infinitive argument:</p> <img src="/assets/img/6e43a93374e4cc2faa07dd9d7f337f188bbd3445.svg"><blockquote><p>praevenit unguere corpus meum in sepulturam</p></blockquote> <img src="/assets/img/00bf8d322a26bd9d96471a2f4cad2595ca0eed8f.svg"><blockquote><p>deus potest iudicare</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>deus est omnipotens</p></blockquote> <p>The facts are the same in both constructions: both <em>iudicare</em>
and <em>omnipotens</em> are selected by the main verb and cannot be
deleted; and they both have external subjects (they do not themselves
govern their subject). For this reason, we treat traditional
predicative complements as XOBJs. A notable case which often appears
is the accusative with participle construction:</p> <img src="/assets/img/5dc414c7c5990b51aa365540c7e4ca978c953f46.svg"><h3 id="empty-nodes"><a href="#empty-nodes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Empty nodes</h3> <p>In our model, we only use empty nodes to stand in for missing
conjunctions in asyndetic coordination and missing verbs in elliptical

ie. to mark a 'null head noun' on which an adjective is dependent.</p> <h2 id="error-messages-during-syntactic-annotation"><a href="#error-messages-during-syntactic-annotation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Error messages during syntactic annotation</h2> <h3 id="must-have-or-inherit-one-outgoing-slash-edge"><a href="#must-have-or-inherit-one-outgoing-slash-edge" class="header-anchor">#</a> 'Must have or inherit one outgoing slash edge'</h3> <p>This error message means that a token which is XADV or XOBJ lacks
a slash arrow.</p> <p>Open predications (XADV and XOBJ, see section \ref{open}) do not
have an 'internal' subject dominated by the predicate. Instead, the
instead the subject is present somewhere else in the same sentence and
should be linked to via a slash arrow. If the subject is not overtly
present in the sentence, it must nevertheless be present in the
argument structure of the governing verb and to represent this we let
the slash arrow point towards the verb.</p> <p>Notice that two XADVs or XOBJs under the same conjunction should
not have one slash arrow each: instead the slash should be put on the
conjunction. It will be inherited by the daughter nodes.</p> <p>If you can't find a suitable target for the slash arrow, the use of
XADV or XOBJ is probably wrong.</p> <h3 id="may-not-be-a-daughter-of-the-root-node"><a href="#may-not-be-a-daughter-of-the-root-node" class="header-anchor">#</a> 'May not be a daughter of the root node'</h3> <p>Only tokens bearing the relations PRED, PARPRED or VOC are allowed as

second one. If there are three PRED tokens, all daughters of the first
one must precede all daughters of the next two; and all daughters of
the second one must precede all daughters of the third one.</p> <p>The reason for this is that if one sentence root has several PRED
daughters, the tree will eventually be 'sawed up' in several trees
each having only one PRED daughter. To assure that this will be
possible, we need to secure that the trees are linearly ordered. If
one sentence is contained in another, you should use the PARPRED
relation instead.</p> <h3 id="slashes-are-not-contained-by-subgraph"><a href="#slashes-are-not-contained-by-subgraph" class="header-anchor">#</a> 'Slashes are not contained by subgraph'</h3> <p>If there are two PRED daughters directly under the root, it is not

should both be daughters of the same PRED.</p> <p>This error message is most likely to occur in the analysis of gapping
in asyndetic coordination. In such cases, it is necessary to conjoin
the two subtree through an empty node, see example \ref{aquitania}.</p> <p>The reason is, as in the preceding section, that two PRED daughters
under the same root will eventually be converted to dependents of one
root each, with no possibility of slashing between them.</p> <h3 id="the-head-of-a-parpred-voc-relation-must-be-the-root-node-or-a-valid-coordination"><a href="#the-head-of-a-parpred-voc-relation-must-be-the-root-node-or-a-valid-coordination" class="header-anchor">#</a> 'The head of a PARPRED/VOC relation must be the root node or a valid coordination'</h3> <p>Elements with the relation VOC or PARPRED should always be made

sentence, but is found in a conjoined sentence, the slash arrow should
point towards the dominating verb, which in turn will have a 'shared
argument' slash arrow to the overt realization of the subject of the

subjunction is not annotated as a conjunction, non-comparable adverb
or something else.</p> <h3 id="a-subjunction-may-only-be-the-dependent-in-a-comp-adv-or-apos-relation"><a href="#a-subjunction-may-only-be-the-dependent-in-a-comp-adv-or-apos-relation" class="header-anchor">#</a> 'A subjunction may only be the dependent in a COMP, ADV or APOS relation'</h3> <p>Subjunctions should always be COMP (if selected for by the verb and
necessary for the sentence), ADV (if introducing an adjunct clause) or
APOS (if dependent on a noun).</p> <p>If you don't understand why you get this message, please go to the
morphological annotation and check whether it is caused by a token
wrongly marked as a subjunction.</p> <h3 id="an-infinitive-may-not-be-the-dependent-in-an-adv-relation"><a href="#an-infinitive-may-not-be-the-dependent-in-an-adv-relation" class="header-anchor">#</a> 'An infinitive may not be the dependent in an ADV relation'</h3> <p>Infinitives can certainly be adverbials (for example final
infinitives), but they always imply a subject and so should be XADVs
instead.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/proiel/dev.syntacticus.org/edit/master/docs/annotation-guide/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edit this page</a> <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></div> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last updated:</span> <span class="time">10/10/2021, 9:59:10 PM</span></div></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
